Why Our RAG Model Is Better

By building a custom RAG pipeline, we get full control over how data flows:

    We choose the embedding model, optimizing for accuracy and cost.

    We store data in Pinecone, a scalable vector database with customizable search, filtering, and metadata support.

    We define how documents are chunked, structured, and refined — which dramatically improves answer quality.

    We can integrate semantic triples, institutional metadata, and advanced filtering — something no OpenAI assistant can currently do.

    Most importantly, we can scale to thousands of documents and handle complex logic across multiple data types.

Conclusion

OpenAI’s tools are powerful but limited in scope. For a robust Deloitte MVP — where credibility, traceability, and scale matter — we need a RAG pipeline. It gives us the building blocks to structure, store, and query institutional knowledge intelligently and responsibly.

Let’s keep control of the process, and build something that actually grows with our needs.

# Assistants API
You can't choose your own embedding model or vector DB.
Not suitable for complex workflows or strict data governance.
Limited transparency over how files are chunked or embedded.

# ChatGPT Pro (via GPT-4 Turbo with Files)
Not scalable for large document sets.
No vector search or fine-tuning logic.
No persistent retrieval or memory beyond the session.
No control over how documents are split
Multi-modal ingestion (PDF + Excel + Metadata) is limited compared to RAG model
