    "content": "Emphasis of matter – basis of accounting \nWe draw attention to note 2(a) to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the basis of \naccounting and the significant differences between such basis of accounting and Canadian public sector \naccounting standards. Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements discloses the impact of these \ndifferences. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. \nResponsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the \nconsolidated financial statements \nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with \nthe accounting requirements of Section 23.1 of the Budget Transparency and Accountability Act of the \nProvince of British Columbia, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to \nenable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \nwhether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the \nInstitute’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going \nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate \nthe Institute or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Institute’s financial reporting process. \nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as \na whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s \nreport that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards \nwill always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and \nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and \nobtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of \nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, \nas fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control.",

The Institute is a not-for-profit entity \ngoverned by a Board of Governors, the majority of whom are appointed by the Province. The Institute is a \nregistered charity and is exempt from income taxes under Section 149 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) .  \nThe Institute provide courses of instruction in advanced technological and vocational fields  to nearly 50,000 \nfull and part-time students annually and operates across five main campuses in the Province.  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic permanently changed the business and financial landscape for many organizations \nincluding the Institute and other post-secondary institutions across Canada.  Management continues to \nmonitor the ongoing financial impact to the Institute and is making operational changes, as necessary,  to \nensure its ability to fulfill financial obligations for years to come, while continuing to preserve and enhance \nstudents’ academic experience. \n2 Summary of significant accounting policies \n(a) Basis of accounting \nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23.1 of the Budget \nTransparency and Accountability Act of the Province of British Columbia supplemented by Regulations \n257/2010 and 198/2011 issued by the Province of British Columbia Treasury Board.  \nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act requires that the consolidated financial statements be \nprepared in accordance with the set of standards and guidelines that comprise generally accepted \naccounting principles for senior governments in Canada, or if the Treasury Board makes a regulation, the \nset of standards and guidelines that comprise generally accepted accounting principles for senior \ngovernments in Canada as modified by the alternate standard or guideline or part thereof adopted in the \nregulations. \nRegulation 257/2010 requires all taxpayer supported organizations in the Schools, Universities, Colleges \nand Hospitals sectors to adopt Canadian public sector accounting standards without any PS4200 elections \nrelated to not-for-profit accounting standards. \nRegulation 198/2011 requires that restricted contributions received or receivable are to be reported as \nrevenue depending on the nature of the restrictions on the use of the funds as follows: \n• Contributions for the purposes of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible capital asset or \ncontributions in the form of a depreciable tangible capital asset are to be deferred and recognized in \nrevenue at the same rate that amortization of the related tangible capital asset is recorded.  \n• Contributions restricted for specific purposes other than those for the acquisition or development of a \ndepreciable tangible capital asset are recorded as deferred contributions and recognized in revenue in \nthe period in which the stipulation or restriction on the contributions have been met.",

Controlled organizations are consolidated except \nfor government business enterprises and partnerships which are accounted for by the modified equity \nmethod. All balances and transactions between the Institute and the consolidated entities have been \neliminated on consolidation. \nThe following organization is controlled by the Institute and fully consolidated in these financial \nstatements: \n• BCIT Foundation which is a controlled not-for-profit organization and is incorporated under the \nSocieties Act (British Columbia). The purpose of BCIT Foundation is to raise funds in order to \nfurther the goals, objectives and strategic interests of the Institute; to stimulate and provide \nfinancial support for the development and expansion of educational programs, services, capital \nprojects and other initiatives as recommended by the Institute; and to provide financial support \nto enable students to participate in learning at the Institute. \n(ii) Investment in government business enterprises and partnerships  \nGovernment business enterprises and partnerships are accounted for by the modified equity method. \nUnder this method, the Institute’s investment in the business enterprise and its net income and other \nchanges in equity are recorded. No adjustment is made to conform the accounting policies of the \ngovernment business enterprise/partnership to those of the Institute.  \nThe following organizations are controlled government business enterprises and partnerships and are \nconsolidated in these financial statements using the modified equity method:",

The purpose of the Trust is to develop an integrated, learning -centred campus with a \nhigh-technology focus, supported by new media and telecommunication technologies. The Trust’s \nactivities currently comprise two distinct business activities: property management and site \ndevelopment activities, and educational activities. \n• TTA Technology Training Associates Ltd. (TTA) is a wholly owned corporation, which was \nincorporated July 12, 1999 under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

These \ninvestments generally have a maturity date of three months or less at acquisition and are held for the \npurpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investing. \n(d) Inventories for resale and held for use \nInventories of merchandise held for resale are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. \nInventories held for use are recorded at the lower of cost and replacement cost. Cost is determined using \nthe first-in, first-out method for all inventories. \n(e) Tangible capital assets \nTangible capital assets are recorded at cost, which includes amounts that are directly attributable to the \nacquisition, construction, development or betterment of the asset and overhead directly attributable to \nconstruction and development. Interest is capitalized over the development period whenever external debt \nis issued to finance the construction and development of tangible capital assets.  \nDonated assets are recorded at fair market value at the date of acquisition.  When fair value of the donated \nasset cannot be reliably determined, the asset is recorded at nominal value.",

These plans are defined benefit plans, providing \npension on retirement based on the member’s age at retirement, length of service and highest earnings \naveraged over five years. As the assets and liabilities of the plans are not segregated by institution, the \nplans are accounted for as defined contribution plans and any Institute contributions to the plans are \nexpensed as incurred. \nThe Institute also provides certain benefits, including accumulated sick and vacation pay , retirement \nallowance, group benefits and life insurance, for certain employees pursuant to certain contracts and union \nagreements. The costs of these benefits are actuarially determined based on service and management’s best \nestimate of salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected plan benefits costs. The obligation \nunder these benefit plans is accrued based on projected benefits as the employees render services \nnecessary to earn the future benefits. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the expected average \nremaining service lives of the employees.",

To the extent that a future event is likely to confirm that a liability has been \nincurred at the date of the financial statements and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made by \nthe Institute, a contingent liability is recognized in the Statement of Financial Position and the related \nexpense is recorded in the Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus in accordance with its \nnature. The Institute discloses contingencies in the consolidated financial statements if  the likelihood of \nthe occurrence of the confirming future event is not determinable or it is likely but either the amount of the \nliability cannot be reasonably estimated, or an accrual has been made, but there exists an exposure to \nliability in excess of the amount accrued. \n(h) Asset retirement obligation \nThe Institute recognizes the fair value of a future asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in \nwhich it incurs a statutory, contractual or legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long -\nlived assets that results from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets.  \nThe obligation is measured at the best estimate of the future cash flows required to settle the liability, \ndiscounted at estimated credit-adjusted risk-free discount rates. The estimated amount of the asset \nretirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related tangible capital asset and \namortized over the life of the asset. \nThe liability is accreted to reflect the passage of time. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the asset \nretirement obligation is adjusted each year for changes in factors such as the amount and timing of \nexpected underlying cash flows, or discount rates, with the offsetting amount recorded to the carrying \namount of the related asset.",

The new standard differentiates between revenue arising from transactions that include \nperformance obligations, referred to as \"exchange transactions\", and transactions that do not have \nperformance obligations, referred to as \"non-exchange transactions\". The adoption of this standard did not \nhave a material impact on these consolidated financial statements. \nTuition fees, ancillary revenue and industry services are recognized as revenue w hen performance \nobligations are satisfied at the time the products are delivered or as the services are provided  over a period \nof time. Revenue related to fees or services received in advance of the fee being earned or the service \nperformed is deferred until the fee is earned or service performed.  \nInvestment income includes interest recorded on an accrual basis and dividends recorded as declared, \nrealized gains and losses on the sale of investments and writedowns on investments where the loss in value \nis determined to be other than temporary. Unrestricted donations and grants are recorded as revenue \nwhen receivable if the amounts can be estimated and there is a past event that gives rise to  an inflow of \neconomic resources. Pledges from donors are recorded as revenue when payment is received by the \nInstitute or the transfer of property is completed. \nRestricted donations and grants are reported as revenue depending on the nature of the restrictions on the \nuse of the funds by the contributors as follows: \n(i)  Contributions for the purpose of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible capital asset or in \nthe form of a depreciable tangible capital asset, in each case for use in providing services, are \nrecorded and referred to as deferred capital contributions and recognized in revenue at the same \nrate that amortization of the tangible capital asset is recorded. The reduction of the deferred capital \ncontributions and the recognition of the revenue are accounted for in the fiscal period during which \nthe tangible capital asset is used to provide services. \n(ii) Contributions restricted for specific purposes other than for those to be held in perpetuity or the \nacquisition or development of a depreciable tangible capital asset are recorded as deferred \ncontributions and recognized in revenue in the year in which the stipulation or restriction on the \ncontribution has been met. \n(iii) Contributions to be retained in perpetuity are classified as endowment donations and are recorded \nas revenue when received. Investment income earned on endowment principal is recorded as \ndeferred revenue if it meets the definition of a liability and is recognized as revenue in the year \nrelated expenses are incurred. If the investment income earned does not meet the definition of a \nliability, it is recognized as revenue in the year it is earned.",

These are accounted for as \nan asset and an obligation. Capital lease obligations are recorded at the present value of the minimum lease \npayments excluding executor costs such as insurance and maintenance costs. The discount rate used to \ndetermine the present value of the lease payments is the lower of the Institute’s rate for incremental \nborrowing or the interest rate implicit in the lease.  \nAll other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the related payments are charged to expenses as \nincurred. \n(k) Financial instruments \nFinancial instruments are classified into two categories: fair value or cost.  \n(i) Fair value category: Portfolio investments, endowment investments and derivative financial \ninstruments that are quoted in an active market are reflected at fair value as at the reporting date. \nSales and purchases of investments are recorded on the trade date. Transaction costs related to the \nacquisition of investments are recorded as an expense. Unrealized gains and losses on financial \nassets are recognized in the consolidated statement of remeasurement of gains (losses) until such \ntime that the financial asset is derecognized due to disposal or impairment. At the time of \nderecognition, the related realized gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of \noperations and accumulated surplus and related balances reversed from the consolidated statement \nof remeasurement of gains (losses). \n(ii) Cost category: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, due to/from government and other \ngovernment organizations, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, debt and obligations under \ncapital lease are measured at cost using the effective interest rate method. Any gains, losses or \ninterest expense is recorded in the annual surplus depending on the nature of the financial \nasset/liability that gave rise to the gain, loss or expense. Valuation allowances are made when \ncollection is in doubt. \n(l) Functional classification of expenses \nThe Institute has identified the following segments and associated groups of activities based upon the \nfunctional areas of service as provided by various departments within the Institute:  \n(i) Academic and student support \nAcademic and student support includes expenses related to the direct support of academic \nfunctions, as well as centralized functions that support students and groups of students. This \nincludes Student Services, Research & Planning, International Education, Learner Services, \nLearning & Teaching Centre, Library, Marketing & Communication, Print Services  and Registrar’s \nOffice.",

Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate \nto the determination of the useful lives for amortization of tangible capital assets and deferred capital \ncontributions, the valuation of employee future benefit obligations, future cash flows associated with asset \nretirement obligations, the provision for uncollectible accounts  and the provision for contingencies.

Investments in pooled investment \nfunds are measured at fair value, which represents the Institute’s proportionate share of underlying net assets \nat fair value determined using closing market values. The unit net asset value is supplied by the pooled fund \nadministrator.

The boards of trustees for these plans, representing plan members and employers, \nare responsible for administering the plans, including investment of assets and administration of benefits. \nThe plans are multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Basic pension benefits are based on a \nformula. As at August 31, 2023, the College Pension Plan has about 17,200 active members, and \napproximately 10,700 retired members. As at December 31, 2022, the Municipal Pension Plan has about \n240,000 active members, including approximately 7,000 from colleges.  \nEvery three years, an actuarial valuation is performed to assess the financial position of the plans and \nadequacy of plan funding. The actuary determines an appropriate combined employer and member \ncontribution rate to fund the plans. The actuary’s calculated contribution rate is based on the entry- \nage normal cost method, which produces the long-term rate of member and employer contributions \nsufficient to provide benefits for average future entrants to the plans. This rate may be adjusted for the \namortization of any actuarial funding surplus and will be adjusted for the amortization of any unfunded \nactuarial liability. \nThe most recent actuarial valuation for the College Pension Plan as at August 31, 2021, indicated a  \n$202 million surplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.  \nThe most recent valuation for the Municipal Pension Plan as at December 31, 2021, indicated a  \n$3,761 million funding surplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.  \nThe Institute paid $22.1 million for employer contributions to the plans in fiscal 2024 (2023 –$19.7 \nmillion), consisting of $17.5 million to the College Pension Plan and $4.6 million to the Municipal Pension \nPlan.  \nThe next valuation for the College Pension Plan will be as at August 31, 2024. The next valuation for the \nMunicipal Pension Plan will be December 31, 2024. \nEmployers participating in the plans record their pension expense as the amount of employer \ncontributions made during the fiscal year (defined contribution pension plan accounting). This is because \nthe plans record accrued liabilities and accrued assets for each plan in aggregate, resulting in no consistent \nand reliable basis for allocating the obligation, assets and cost to individual employers participating in the \nplans.",

The Board of Governors ensures that the Institute has \nidentified major risks and management monitors and controls them. \n(a) Liquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Institute will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become \ndue. The Institute establishes budgets, monitors actuals and forecasts cash flow projections to ensure that \nit has the necessary funds to meet its obligations as they become due.  \n(b) Market and interest rate risk \nMarket risk is the risk that fluctuations in market prices will affect the Institute’s net assets and the value \nof holdings in investments. The objective of market risk management is to control market risk exposure \nwithin acceptable parameters while optimizing the return on risk. Market risk comprised  of the following: \n(i) Interest rate risk \nInterest rate risk refers to the effect on the market value of the Institute’s assets due to the \nfluctuations in interest rates. The market value of the Institute’s investments in fixed income pooled \nfunds is also affected by fluctuations in interest rates. The Institute has entered into a derivative for \nthe purpose of mitigating exposure to future interest rate fluctuations.  \n(ii) Foreign currency risk \nForeign exchange risk is the risk of financial impact due to exchange rate fluctuations. The Institute \nhas investments in global pooled equity funds where the underlying securities are denominated in \nforeign currencies. The Institute manages this risk by diversifying its investment portfolio in \naccordance with its approved investment policy. \nThe Institute manages its market risks on its investments by investing in funds that have a \nwell-diversified portfolio of securities. \n(c) Credit risk \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Institute if a customer or counterparty to a financial \ninstrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Such risks arise principally from certain financial \nassets held by the Institute consisting of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable.  \nThe Institute manages credit risk with established credit management and investment policies and \nguidelines that include regular monitoring of each debtor’s payment history and performance.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province. CAS \ncan support you in public sector governance best practices, policy and planning. \nI expect you to ensure the important priorities and areas of focus listed in this letter are incorporated \ninto the practices of your institution and develop plans to address the following new priorities within \nyour approved budget and within the following context. \nPost-secondary education and training are fundamental for anyone who wishes to access and \nsucceed in most careers in our province. We know that 80 per cent of the 1 million new job openings \nin BC over the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. The StrongerBC \nFuture Ready Action Plan aims to make education and training more accessible, affordable and \nrelevant to prepare British Columbians for the jobs of tomorrow. Achieving the objectives of the \nAction Plan will require collaboration across many sectors, driven by the post-secondary sector.",

We acknowledge that the relationship with  \nIndigenous peoples in Canada has been troubled and must  \nbe reconciled; we are deeply committed to doing our part. \nWe are guided by the BCIT Indigenous Vision, the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \nIndigenous Peoples, British Columbia’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act,  \nand the Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education and Training Policy Framework and Action Plan  \nby the British Columbia Ministry of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills. Truth, \nIndigenization, and Reconciliation are priorities for BCIT. We deeply value our relationship  \nwith Indigenous peoples throughout the province and beyond. \nLong-term Financial Sustainability\nAt BCIT, our core mission of delivering high-quality academic curriculum that supports student \nlearning remains at the forefront of everything we do. As a recognized leader in strategic workforce \ndevelopment for British Columbia, we are committed to adapting to the changing landscape of \nhigher education in Canada. In response to emerging challenges—including shifts in federal and \nprovincial policies, evolving workplace demands, and financial pressures—BCIT has launched  \na proactive, multi-year strategy to secure the long-term financial sustainability of the Institute.\nGiven the capital-intensive nature of our programming—from advanced technology to specialized \nequipment and infrastructure and the financial support required to meet the increased needs of \nstudents—our strategy will enable us to live within our core operating funding, comprised primarily \nof grants and domestic tuition.\nBy focusing on sustainable financial practices, we are building a foundation that will weather \nuncertainties and ensure appropriate investment is earmarked to support the Strategic Plan— \ntoday and into the future. This approach ensures that BCIT will continue to deliver the high-quality, \napplied education that students rely on without compromising future generations’ access to these \nsame opportunities.\nCritical to the success of the Strategic Plan is BCIT’s Enterprise Risk Management framework. \nWith a lens to the overall plan, we have ensured that the inherent assumptions applied to the \ndevelopment of the Strategic Plan were considered and that BCIT could identify, understand,  \nand mitigate risks within the Plan.\nAt the heart of our financial strategy is our commitment to intergenerational equity. By adopting \nprudent financial principles now, we ensure that BCIT will continue to be a leader in applied \neducation and workforce development for decades to come.",

    "content": "3\nThe Starting Point\nThe heart of BCIT is its robust and dynamic education model, characterized by flexibility, \ninterdisciplinary approaches, and work-integrated learning. With nearly 45,000 students pursuing \ndiverse credentials and over 210,000 proud alumni, our community demonstrates remarkable \nengagement and real-world success. The INSPIRE campaign goal of raising over $125 million \nhas been achieved, underscoring our commitment to access, inclusion, and innovative campus \ndevelopment. The daylighting of Guichon Creek is a leading example of our commitment to ecology \nand sustainability. Our leadership and community exemplify our adaptability to evolving educational \nneeds as represented by our microcredentials and Agile Learning Framework. Our strong emphasis \non sustainability, experiential learning, and establishing critical facilities highlights our dedication \nto advancing education and environmental stewardship.\nDespite our many strengths, BCIT faces internal challenges that require addressing to meet our \nfull potential. Our students and employees experience constraints due to complex processes and \nsystems impacting efficiency and collaboration. We recognize that BCIT requires robust digital \ninfrastructure to enable our abilities and build capacity, which is why digital transformation  \nremains a critical priority. To address this priority, BCIT has created an investment fund to support \ndigital technologies, while establishing a new financial model to continue providing for future \nstrategic investment.\nBCIT stands at the cusp of unprecedented opportunity, driven by rapid advancements in artificial \nintelligence, technology, and shifting industry needs that will create a positive experience for \nstudents and employees navigating our systems. Our expertise in applied education and research \npositions us to be a leader in advancing all the major sectors of the economy, including healthcare, \nenergy, the built environment, transportation, digital transformation, and business. The growing \ndemand for skills-based and modular learning aligns seamlessly with our education model. \nExpanding our partnerships with industry and other educational institutions will amplify our impact \nand reach. Our commitment to Indigenization, equity, diversity, and inclusion enriches the learning \nexperience by fostering an inclusive environment, offering all learners greater opportunities  \nfor support, growth, and success in a diverse and globalized world. Finally, there is an opportunity  \nto enhance our learning environment by advancing our international student program, focusing  \non diversity, skill development, and global recognition to stay ahead in educational innovation.\nWe remain mindful of changes in BC, across Canada, and globally. The COVID-19 pandemic \naccelerated existing trends: early retirements increased, work environments evolved rapidly,  \nand new technologies, including artificial intelligence, were—and continue to be—adopted quicker \nthan ever. The post-secondary landscape is increasingly competitive, with regional peers vying  \nfor a shrinking pool of domestic students due to demographic shifts. Economic and geopolitical \nfactors continue to exacerbate operating and capital costs and pose ongoing risks to our strategic \ninitiatives. Amid this technological reliance, we remain vigilant against cybersecurity threats  \nand the potential, across the globe, for severe financial and reputational damage.\nFurther, rapidly changing industry needs require continuous and quick adaptation to ensure our \nprograms remain relevant and practical. Most importantly, we are moving forward with an acute \nawareness that recent global challenges have highlighted inequities in access to higher education \nwhile also highlighting the critical need for programs that support mental health and wellbeing. \nAddressing these changes will be crucial as we remain a leader in applied education.",

    "content": "7\nDeveloping the Plan\nEngagement Process\nThe development of our Strategic Plan was driven by a comprehensive and inclusive engagement \nprocess involving a wide range of interest holders across BCIT. Our goal was to create a Strategic \nPlan that reflects the diverse needs and aspirations of our community while fostering a sense of \ncollaboration integral to the BCIT experience.\nThrough our consultation, we connected with students, employees, the BCIT Student Association, \nand the Alumni Board of Directors. We also collaborated closely with the BCIT Executive Team and \nthe BCIT Board of Governors to craft a Strategic Plan that is both led by the Board and informed  \nby the wider BCIT community.\nThroughout this engagement process, we invited our community to share their vision for BCIT’s \ncollective future, emphasizing the need for focus, expertise, and specialization to tackle the \nchallenges of our increasingly complex world.\nWhat We Learned\nOur engagements resulted in invaluable insights from the BCIT community, reflecting a strong \ncommitment to growth and excellence. The touchpoints with the community revealed themes  \nthat underscored what a supportive and collective vision of the future could look like while  \nsetting the foundation for developing the commitments and initiatives.\n 1.  Student Experience Enhancement : There is consensus on enhancing the educational \njourney at BCIT by focusing on digital and physical learner experiences. This includes \nimproving digital platforms and fostering a vibrant campus culture that supports  \nlearning and personal growth.\n 2.  Community Health and Wellbeing : Our community emphasizes the importance of mental \nhealth and overall wellbeing and advocates for integrated support services that cater \ncomprehensively to student and employee needs.\n 3.  Innovative and Relevant Education : A curriculum that evolves with the rapidly changing \nworld is needed, equipping students with the adaptable skills and knowledge required  \nto thrive in the future through real-world, work-integrated learning opportunities.\nThrough an IDEAS Lens\nThe implementation of this Strategic Plan will be further guided by the IDEAS Lens. IDEAS stands  \nfor Indigenous, Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, Sustainability, and Student Wellbeing  \nand provides an orientation to our way of working together and relating to each other. Through  \nthe application of the IDEAS Lens, we can develop tools that help us infuse IDEAS across BCIT.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(a) Basis of accounting (continued): \nThe accounting policy requirements under Regulation 198/2011 are significantly different \nfrom the requirements of Canadian public sector accounting standards which requires that: \n• government transfers, which do not contain a stipulation that creates a liability, be \nrecognized as revenue by the recipient when approved by the transferor and the eligibility \ncriteria have been met in accordance with public sector accounting standard PS3410 \nGovernment Transfers; and \n• externally restricted contributions be recognized as revenue in the period in which the \nresources are used for the purpose or purposes spec ified in accordance with public \nsector accounting standard PS3100 Restricted Assets and Revenues; and \n• deferred contributions meet the liability criteria in accordance with PS3200 Liabilities. \nAs a result, revenue recognized in the statement of  operations and certain related deferred \ncapital contributions are recorded differently under Canadian Public Sector Accounting \nStandards. \n(b) Inventories for resale: \nInventories held for resale, comprised of bookstore inventory, is recorded at the lower o f \naverage cost or net realizable value. Cost includes the original purchase cost, plus shipping \nand applicable duties. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less any costs to sell. \n(c) Tangible capital assets: \nTangible c apital assets are recorded at cost , which includes amounts that are directly \nattributable to acquisition, construction, development, or betterment of the asset. \nThe cost, less residual value, of the tangible capital assets, excluding land, is amortized on a \nstraight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: \n \nCategory  Period \n \nBuildings  20 to 40 years \nCollege system software  10 years \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment  5 years \nComputers and software  3 years \n \n \nAssets under construction are not amortized until the asset is available for productive use. \nTangible capital assets are written down when conditions indicate that they no longer \ncontribute to the College’s ability to provide goods and services, or when the value of future \neconomic benefits associated with the tangible capital assets are less than their net book \nvalue. The net write-downs are accounted for as expenses in the statement of operations.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(c) Tangible capital assets (continued): \nContributed capital assets are recorded at their fair market value on the date of donation, \nexcept in circumstances where fair value cannot be reasonably determined, in which case \nthey are recognized at nominal value. Transfers of capital assets from related parties are \nrecorded at carrying value. \nOn July 14, 1983 certain land was transferred to  the College by order of the Lieutenant- \nGovernor in Council. These assets have been recorded at a nominal value of $1. Title to the \nassets is transferred subject to their continued use for educational purposes. \nWorks of art and historic assets are not recognized in these financial statements. \nLeases which transfer substantially all of the benefit and risks incidental to ownership of \nproperty are accounted for as leased tangible capital as sets. All oth er leases are accounted \nfor as operating leases and the related payments are charged to expenses as incurred. \nCapital lease obligations are recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments \nexcluding executory costs. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the \nlease p ayments is the lower of the College’s rate for incremental borrowing or the \ninterest rate implicit in the lease. The maximum recorded value of the leased assets cannot \nexceed the leased property’s fair value when determining the discount rate to be used.  \n(d) Employee future benefits: \n(i) The College and its employees contribute to the College Pension Plan and the Municipal \nPension Plan, which are multi-employer joint trustee plans. The plans are defined benefit \nplans providing a pension on retirement based on the member’s age at retirement, length \nof service and earnings. As the assets and liabilities of the plans are not segregated by \ninstitution, t he pl ans ar e a ccounted for as  defined contribution pl ans and a ny \ncontributions of the College to the plans are expensed as incurred. \n(ii) Sick leave benefits are also available to certain College employees. The costs of \nthese benefits are  actuarially determined based on service and best estimates of \nretirement ages and  expected future salary and wage increases. The obligations \nunder these benefit plans are accrued based on projected benefits as the employees \nrender services nec essary to  earn the future benefits. Actuarial gains and losses are \namortized over the expected average remaining service life of the employees. Similarly, \nthe cost and obligation of non-vesting sick leave benefits is actuarially determined using \nmanagement’s best estimate of salary escalation, accumulated sick days at retirement, \nlong-term inflation rates and discount rates.  \n(iii) Certain College employees are entitled to the continuation of health and dental benefits \nwhile on disability leave. The accrued benefit obligation for currently disabled employees \nwas estimated by an actuarial valuation for accounting purposes at March 31, 2024.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(h) Financial instruments: \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are measured at cost or amortized cost, l ess any \npermanent impairment in value. The College does n ot hold any derivatives or equity \ninvestments that require fair value reporting and has not elected to record any other financial \ninstruments at fair value.  \nA statement of remeasurement gains and losses is not presented as the College did not have \nremeasurement transactions to report. \nFinancial instruments are adjusted by transaction costs incurred on acquisition and financing \ncosts, which are amortized using the straight-line method. \nAll financial a ssets are assessed for impairment on an annual basis. Whe n a decline is \ndetermined to be other than temporary, the amount of the loss is reported in the statement of \noperations. \n(i) Cash and cash equivalents: \nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short term  highly liquid investments \nthat are readily  convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of \nchange in value. These short term investments generally have a maturity of three months or \nless at acquisition and are held for the purpose of meeting short term cash commitments \nrather than investing. \n(j) Asset retirement obligation: \nAn asset retirement obligation is recognized when, as at the financial reporting date, all of the \nfollowing criteria are met:  \n• There is a legal obligation to incur retirement costs in relation to a tangible capital asset;  \n• The past transaction or event giving rise to the liability has occurred;  \n• It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and  \n• A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.  \nThe liability for the removal of asbestos in several of the buildings owned by the College has \nbeen recognized based on estimated cost of remediation at the date of adoption on April 1, \n2022. Under the modified retrospective met hod, the assumptions used on initial recognition \nare those as of the date of adoption of the standard. Assumptions used in the subsequent \ncalculations are revised yearly.  \nThe liability is estimated at the current cost of remediation if this was to occur at the financial \nstatement date.  This liability is a djusted yearly based on a remediation cost escalation \npercentage as an accretion expense. The recognition of a liability resulted in an \naccompanying increase in the respective tangible capital assets. The buildings capital assets \naffected by the asbestos liabilit y are being amortized with the building s over their original \nremaining useful lives.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(k) Measurement uncertainty: \nThe preparation of the f inancial statements requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of \ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported \namounts of reve nues and expenses during the period. Key areas where management has \nmade estimates and assumptions include those related to the determination of the useful \nlives of capital assets, amortization of related deferred capital contributions, asset retirement \nobligations, determination of employee future benefits, and provisions for accounts receivable \nand contingencies. Where actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions, the \nimpact is recorded in future periods when the differences become known. \n \n3. Adoption of new accounting standards: \n(a) On April 1, 2023, the College adopted Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standard PS \n3400, Revenue (“PS 3400”). Under the new accounting standard, there  are two categories of \nrevenue – exchange and non- exchange. If th e transaction gives rise to one or more \nperformance obligation s, it is  an exchange transaction. If no performance obligations are \npresent, it is a non-exchange transaction. Management has assessed the impact of adopting \nPS 3400 on the financial statements of the College and has found that there is no resulting \nimpact to the amounts presented in these financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or \nafter April, 2023. \n(b) On April 1, 2023, the College adopted Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standard PS \n3160, Public Private Partnerships  (“PS 3160”). The new accounting standard addresses the \nrecognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of infrastructure procured by public \nsector entities through certain types of public private partnership arrangements. Management \nhas assessed the impact of adopting PS 3160 on the financial statements of the College and \nhas found that at present no such items meet the criteria to be recognized as a public private \npartnership.  \n(c) On April 1, 2023, the College adopted Public Sector Guideline PSG -8, Purchased \nIntangibles, applied on a prospective basis (“PSG -8”). PSG-8 defines purchased intangibles \nas identifiable non- monetary economic resources without physical substance acquired \nthrough an arm’s length exchange transacti on between knowledgeable, willing parties who \nare under no compulsion to act. Intangibles acquired through a transfer, contribution, or inter-\nentity transaction, are not purchased intangibles. Management has assessed the impact of \nadopting PSG-8 and found that at present no such items meet the criteria to be recogniz ed \nas a purchased intangible.",

Employee future benefits (continued): \n(b) Pension plans: \nThe College and its employees contribute to the College Pension Plan and Municipal Pension \nPlan (jointly trusteed pension plan s). The boards of trustees for these plans, representing \nplan members and employers, are responsible for administering the plans, including \ninvestment of assets and administration of benefits. The plans are multi -employer defined \nbenefit pension plans. Basic pension benefits are based on a formula. As at August 31, 2023, \nthe College Pension Plan has about 17,200 active members, and approximately 10,700 \nretired members. As at December 31, 2022, t he Municipal Pension Plan has about 240,000 \nactive members, including approximately 7,000 from colleges. \nEvery three years, an actuarial valuation is performed to assess the financial position of the \nplans and adequacy of plan funding. The actuary determin es an appropriate combined \nemployer and member contribution rat e to fund the plans. The actuary’s calculated \ncontribution rate is based on the entry -age normal cost method, which produces the long -\nterm rate of member and employer contributions sufficient t o provide benefits for average \nfuture entrants to the plans. T his rate may be adjusted for the amortization of any actuarial \nfunding surplus and will be adjusted for the amortization of any unfunded actuarial liability. \nThe most recent actuarial valuation for the College Pension Plan as at August 31, 2021, \nindicated a $202 million surplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis. \nThe most recent valuation for the Municipal Pension Plan as at December 31, 2021, indicated \na $3,761 million funding surplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis. \nThe next valuation for the College Pension Plan will be as at August 31, 2024. The next \nvaluation for the Municipal Pension Plan will be December 31, 2024. \nEmployers participating in the plans record their pension expense as the amount of employer \ncontributions made during the fiscal year (defined contribution pension plan accounting).

Related party transactions (continued): \n(c) Pacific Institute for Sport Education Society (continued): \nPISE’s facilities, located at the Interurban campus, were completed in September 2008 at \nwhich time the College signed a long- term  lease and license agreement with PISE \nunder which PISE will operate the facility for a 25-year  term with a 29-year  extension option \nat an annual rent of $1 per year. At the same time, PISE has signed a long-term sub lease \nwith the College under similar terms under which the College will operate its sport education \nprograms, recreation and athletics programs and teams and applied research activities at an \nannual cost of $727,049 (2024) and $789,383 (2025).  A renewal of the sublease is expected \nin the 2025 fiscal year. \nAt the date of occupancy, the related $28 million cost of the capital asset s under construction \nand associated deferred capital grants were removed from the College’s financial statements. \nThe College provides custodial, grounds, maintenance,  and other specialist facility services \nto PISE on a cost recovery basis under  a service agreement. Fees and expenses for these \nservices amounted to $302,985 (2023 - $302,985) during the year. Included in the College’s \naccounts receivable at March 31, 2024 is $10,105 (2023 - $1,763) due from PISE. Included in \nthe College’s accounts payable at March 31, 2024 is $7,151 (2023 - $3,000) due to PISE.  \n \n17. Financial risk management: \nIt is management’s opinion that the College is not exposed to significant risk from its use of \nfinancial instruments which could affect its ability to achieve its strategic objectives. \n(a)  Liquidity risk: \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the College will not be able to meet its financial obligations as \nthey become due. The C ollege establishes budgets and cash flow projections to ensure that \nit has the necessary funds to meet its obligations as they become due. \n(b)  Interest rate risk: \nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of floating rate instruments \nwill fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  It is management’s opinion that the \nCollege is not exposed to excessive levels of interest rate risk arising from its financial \ninstruments.  \n(c)  Credit risk: \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the College if a client of the College or counterparty to \na financial inst rument fails to meet their co ntractual obligations. Such risks arise principally \nfrom certain financial assets held by the College consisting of cash, investments,  and \naccounts receivable. The risk is mitigated by the College’s prompt collections processes and \nby other remedies such as the withholding of transcripts in the event of non-payment.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province.

Management is also responsible for all of the notes to the \nconsolidated financial statements and for ensuring that this information is consistent, where appropriate, with the \ninformation contained in the consolidated financial statements. A summary of the significant accounting policies \nare described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial \nstatements necessarily involves the use of estimates based on management's judgment, particularly when \ntransactions affecting the current accounting period cannot be finalized with certainty until future periods. \nManagement is also responsible for implementing and maintaining a system of internal controls to provide \nreasonable assurance that reliable financial information is produced. The internal controls are designed to provide \nreasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are properly authorized and recorded in \ncompliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, and reliable financial information is available on a timely \nbasis for preparation of the consolidated financial statements. \nThe Douglas College Board is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial \nreporting and internal control and exercises these responsibilities through the Audit, Finance and Investment \nCommittee. The Audit, Finance and Investment Committee reviews financial information on a quarterly basis and \nexternal audited financial statements yearly. \nThe College’s external auditor, KPMG LLP, conducts an independent examination, in accordance with Canadian \nauditing standards, and expresses their opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The external auditor has \nfull and free access to management of Douglas College and meets when required. The accompanying \nIndependent Auditor’s Report outlines their responsibilities, the scope of their examination and their opinion on the \nconsolidated financial statements. \nOn behalf of Douglas College: \nKathy Denton Kayoko Takeuchi \nPresident & Chief Executive Officer Vice President, Administrative Services & \nC hief Financial Officer \nJune 20, 2024",

Purpose of the organization: \nDouglas College (the “College”) is a post-secondary educational institution incorporated under the \nCollege and Institute Act of British Columbia and is principally funded by the Province of \nBritish Columbia (the “Province”) through the Mi nistry of Post-Secondary Education and Future \nSkills (the “Ministry”). The College is a not-for-profit entity gover ned by a board of directors (the \n“Board”), the majority of which are appointed by the Province. The College is registered charity and \nexempt from income tax under Section 149 of the Income Tax Act. \nThese consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial position and results of operations \nand accumulated surplus and cash flows of the College and its controlled foundation, the Douglas \nCollege Foundation (the “Foundation”). The Foundation was established to advance education and \ncommunity services and other charitable activiti es beneficial to the College. The Foundation is a \ncontrolled not-for-profit organization and is incorporated under the Societies Act (British Columbia). \nThe Foundation is a registered charity and is exempt from income taxes under Section 149 of the \nIncome Tax Act. \n \n2. Significant accounting policies: \n(a) Basis of accounting: \nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23.1 \nof the Budget Transparency and Accountability Ac t of the Province of British Columbia \nsupplemented by Regulations 257/2010 and 198/2011 issued by the Province of \nBritish Columbia Treasury Board.  \nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Ac t requires that the consolidated financial \nstatements be prepared in accordance with the set of standards and guidelines that comprise \ngenerally accepted accounting principles for senior governments in Canada, or if the Treasury \nBoard makes a regulation, the set of standard s and guidelines that comprise generally \naccepted accounting principles for senior governments in Canada as modified by the alternate \nstandard or guideline or part thereof adopted in the regulation. \nRegulation 257/2010 requires all taxpayer supported organizations in the Schools, Universities, \nColleges and Hospitals sectors to adopt Canadian public sector accounting standards without \nany PS 4200 elections effective their first fiscal year commencing after January 1, 2012.  \nRegulation 198/2011 requires that restricted cont ributions received or receivable are to be \nreported as revenue depending on the nature of the restrictions on the use of the funds by the \ncontributors as follows: \n(i) Contributions for the purpose of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible capital \nasset or contributions in the form of a depreciable tangible capital asset are recorded and, \nreferred to as deferred capital contributions and recognized in revenue at the same rate \nthat amortization of the related tangible capi tal asset is recorded. The reduction of the \ndeferred capital contributions and the recognit ion of the revenue are accounted for in the \nfiscal period during which the tangible capital asset is used to provide services.",

    "content": "DOUGLAS COLLEGE \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) \n \nYear ended March 31, 2024 \n \n7 \n2. Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(a) Basis of accounting (continued): \n(ii) Contributions restricted for specific purp oses other than those for the acquisition or \ndevelopment of a depreciable tangible capital asset are recorded as deferred contributions \nand recognized in revenue in the year in wh ich the stipulation or restriction on the \ncontributions have been met. \nFor British Columbia taxpayer supported organizations, these contributions include \ngovernment transfers and externally restricted contributions. \nThe accounting policy requirements under Regulation 198/2011 are significantly different from \nthe requirements of Canadian public sector accounting standards which require that:  \n Government transfers that do not contain a stipulation that creates a liability, be recognized \nas revenue by the recipient when approved by the transferor and the eligibility criteria have \nbeen met in accordance with public sector accounting standard PS 3410; and \n Externally restricted contributions be recogn ized as revenue in the period in which the \nresources are used for the purpose or purposes specified in accordance with public sector \naccounting standard PS 3100.  \nAs a result, revenue recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated \nSurplus and certain related deferred capital cont ributions would be recorded differently under \nCanadian public sector accounting standards. \n(b) Basis of consolidation: \nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of \nthe College and its controlled organization. All balances and transactions between the College \nand the consolidated entity have been eliminated on consolidation.  \nOn April 17, 2023, there was an amendment to the Foundation’s bylaws which resulted in the \nFoundation being controlled by the College and thus its operations are consolidated into these \nfinancial statements. The impact of the acqu isition of control of the Foundation was \n$16,556,146 which resulted in an increase to Accumulated Surplus. \n(c) Measurement uncertainty: \nThe preparation of the consolidated financi al statements requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect the r eported amounts of assets and liabilities, and \ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilit ies, at the date of the consolidated financial \nstatements and the reported amounts of the rev enue and expenses during the period. Items \nrequiring the use of estimates include thos e related to employee future benefits, the \ndetermination of useful lives for purposes of amortization of tangible capital assets and deferred \ncapital contributions, the fair value of investm ents, liabilities for contaminated sites and asset \nretirement obligations, and provisions for c ontingencies. Estimates are based on the best \ninformation available at the time of preparatio n of the consolidated financial statements and \nare reviewed annually to reflect new information as it becomes available.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(c) Measurement uncertainty (continued): \nMeasurement uncertainty exists in these cons olidated financial statements. Actual results \ncould differ from these estimates. \n(d) Foreign currency translation: \nForeign currency transactions are translated into Canadian dollars at the exchange rate \nprevailing at the date of the transactions. An y gain or loss resulting from a change in rates \nbetween the transaction date and the settlement date or Consolidated Statement of Financial \nPosition date is recognized in the Consolid ated Statement of Remeasurement Gains and \nLosses.  \n(e) Financial instruments: \nFinancial instruments are classified into two categories: fair value or cost.  \n(i) Fair value category: Investment s that are quoted in an active market are reflected at fair \nvalue as at the reporting date. Sales and purchases of investments are recorded on the \ntrade date. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of investments are recorded as an \nexpense. Unrealized gains and losses on financial assets are recognized in the \nConsolidated Statement of Remeasurement Gains and Losses until such time that the \nfinancial asset is derecognized due to disposal or impairment. At the time of derecognition, \nthe related realized gains and losses are reco gnized in the Consolidated Statement of \nOperations and Accumulated Surplus and related balances are reversed from the \nConsolidated Statement of Remeasurement  Gains and Losses. Unrealized gains and \nlosses on endowment investments where earnings are restricted as to use are recorded \nas deferred contributions and recognized in revenue when disposed and when related \nexpenses are incurred. \n(ii) Amortized cost category: Gains and losses ar e recognized in the Consolidated Statement \nof Operations and Accumulated Surplus when the financial asset is derecognized due to \ndisposal or impairment. Sales and purchases of financial assets are recorded on the trade \ndate. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of financial assets are included in the cost \nof the related investments.  \nAccounts receivable, due from government, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, \nsalaries and wages payable, and accrued vacation pay are measured at cost using the \neffective interest rate method. Any gains, losses or interest expense is recorded in the \nannual surplus depending on the nature of the financial asset/liability that gave rise to the \ngain, loss or expense. Valuation allowances are made when collection is in doubt. \n(f) Inventories held for resale: \nInventories held for resale are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost \nincludes the original purchase cost, plus shipping and applicable duties. Net realizable value is \nthe expected selling price in the ordinary course of operations less any costs to sell.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(g) Employee future benefits: \nEmployee future benefits are recorded based on the estimated actuarially determined present \nvalue of the expected future cash flows. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in the year \nthat they arise. Any differences between the actuarial assumptions and future experience will \nemerge as gains or losses in future valuations. \nThe most recent valuation was as of March 31, 2024. The next valuation will be as at March 31, \n2025.  \n(h) Deferred leasehold inducements: \nDeferred leasehold inducements include amounts received in lease agreements related to \nleasehold improvements. Amortization of deferr ed leasehold inducements is recognized over \nthe initial term of the lease on a straight-line basis against supplies and services expense. \n(i) Contaminated sites: \nA liability for contaminated site s is recognized when a site is  not in product ive use and the \nfollowing criteria are met:  \n(i) An environmental standard exists; \n(ii) Contamination exceeds the environmental standard; \n(iii) The College is directly responsible or accepts responsibility; \n(iv) It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and \n(v) A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. \nThe liability is recognized as management’s estimate of costs directly attributable to \nremediation activities and the cost of post-remediation operation, maintenance and monitoring \nthat are an integral part of the remediation strategy for a contaminated site. \n(j) Prepaid expenses: \nPrepaid expenses include lease and contract pa yments charged to expense over the periods \nexpected to benefit from them. \n(k) Tangible capital assets: \nTangible capital assets are initially recorded at cost, which includes amounts that are directly \nrelated to the acquisition, construction, development, improvement or betterment of the assets.",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(k) Tangible capital assets (continued): \nThe cost of the tangible capital assets, excluding land and land improvements, is amortized on \na straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives shown below.

No borrowing costs were capitalized during the year. \nTangible capital assets are written down when conditions indicate that they no longer contribute \nto the College’s ability to provide goods and services, or when the value of future economic \nbenefits associated with the tangible capital assets is less than the net book value. \n(l) Leased tangible capital assets: \nLeases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks incidental to ownership of property \nare accounted for as leased tangible capital assets. All other leases are accounted for as \noperating leases and the related payments are charged to expenses as incurred. \n(m) Asset retirement obligations: \nAn asset retirement obligation is recognized when, as at the financial reporting date, all of the \nfollowing criteria are met:  \n(i) There is a legal obligation to incur retirement  costs in relation to a tangible capital asset; \n(ii) The past transact ion or event giving rise to the liability has occurred; \n(iii) It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and \n(iv) A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. \nThe liability is measured at the best estimate of the future cash flows required to settle the \nliability, discounted using a pres ent value calculation, and adjusted yearly for accretion \nexpense. The estimated amount of the asset retirement obligation is capitalized as part of the \ncarrying value of the related tangible capital asset and amortized over the life of the asset \nfollowing the amortization accounting policies outlines in note 2(k).",

Significant accounting policies (continued): \n(n) Revenue recognition: \nUnrestricted donations and grants are recorded as revenue when received or receivable if the \namounts can be estimated and collection is reasonably assured. \nRestricted donations and grants are reported as revenue depending on the nature of the \nrestrictions on the use of the funds by the contributors as follows:  \n(i)  Contributions for the purpose of acquiri ng or developing a depreciable tangible capital \nasset or in the form of a depreciable tangible capital asset, in each case for use in providing \nservices, are recorded and referred to as deferred capital contributions and recognized in \nrevenue at the same rate that amortization of  the tangible capital asset is recorded. The \nreduction of the deferred c apital contributions and the re cognition of the revenue are \naccounted for in the fiscal period during which the tangible capital asset is used to provide \nservices.  \n(ii)  Contributions restricted for specific purpose s other than for those to be held in perpetuity \nor the acquisition or development of a deprec iable tangible capital asset are recorded as \ndeferred contributions and recognized in revenu e in the year in which the stipulation or \nrestriction on the contribution have been met.  \n(iii) Contributions restricted to be retained in pe rpetuity, allowing only the investment income \nearned thereon to be spent, are recorded as endowment donations on the Consolidated \nStatement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus for the portion to be held in perpetuity \nand as deferred contributions for the investment income earned thereon. \nTuition fees, student fees and sales of goods and services are recognized as revenue at the \ntime the services are provided or the produ cts are delivered, and collection is reasonably \nassured. Tuition fees and student  fees related to the April porti on of the winter semester as \nwell as the upcoming semesters are recorded as deferred revenue. \nInvestment income is recorded on an accrual basis  and includes interest, dividends, realized \ngains/losses on the sale of investments and wr ite-downs on investments where the loss in \nvalue is determined to be other than temporary. \nContract revenues are recognized as revenue in the period in which the related activities are \nperformed. The zero profit margin method is us ed when a contract’s financial outcome is not \nreasonably determinable. This method of a ccounting requires that revenue be recognized \nequal to the related expenses that are incurr ed under the terms of the contract, until the \nfinancial outcome of a contract can be reasonably estimated. When it is determined that a loss \nunder contract is anticipated, revenue is adjust ed to fully provide for the loss.

Adoption of new accounting standards: \n(a) Adoption of PS 3400 Revenue: \nOn April 1, 2023, the College adopted Canadian public sector accounting standard PS 3400 \nRevenue (“PS 3400”). The new accounting standar d establishes a single framework to \ncategorize revenue to enhance the consistency of revenue recognition and its measurement.  \nThe College determined that the adoption of this new standard did not have an impact on the \namounts presented in the financial statements. \n(b) Adoption of PSG-8 Purchased Intangibles: \nOn April 1, 2023, the College adopted public sector guideline PSG-8 Purchased Intangibles \n(“PSG-8”). The new accounting guideline permits recognition of purchased intangibles that are \nacquired through an arm’s length exchange transaction between willing parties provided the \npurchased intangible meets the recognition criteria for an asset.

Risk management: \nThe College has exposure to the following risks from  its use of financial instruments: credit risk, \nmarket risk and liquidity risk. \nThe Board ensures that the College has identified its risks and ensures that management monitors \nand controls them. \n(a) Credit risk: \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to an institution if a customer or counterparty to a financial \ninstrument fails to meet its contractual obligat ions. Such risks arise principally from certain \nfinancial assets held consisting of cash, acc ounts receivable, due from government and \ninvestments. \nThe College is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by a debtor. This risk is \nmitigated as most amounts receivable are due from the provincial and federal governments \nand therefore, are collectible. \nIt is management’s opinion that the College is exposed to some credit risk associated with its \ncash deposits and investments. The College assesses these assets on a continuous basis and \nensures the amounts are collectible or realizable. The College’s fixed income portfolio is \ninvestment grade. Investment grade bonds are those that have a credit rating of either A, AA, \nAAA or BBB and are considered to have relatively low risk of default. \n(b) Market risk: \nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will \nfluctuate because of changes in  market prices. Market risk is comprised of currency risk, \ninterest rate risk and other price risk. \n Currency risk: \nCurrency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will \nfluctuate because of changes in the foreign exchange rates.  \n Interest rate risk: \nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument \nwill fluctuate because of changes in the market interest rates.  \n Other price risk: \nOther price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument \nwill fluctuate because of changes in market pr ices (other than those arising from interest \nrate risk or currency risk), whether those ch anges are caused by factors specific to the \nindividual financial instrument or its issuer , or factors affecting all similar financial \ninstruments traded in the market. \nIt is management’s opinion that the College is exposed to some market risk associated with its \ninvestments. The College monitors these investments on a continuous basis and ensures \ninvestments are within the parameters of the applicable investment policies.",

Management has determined that \nthere are no significant claims against the College resulting from such litigation that would \nmaterially affect the consolidated financial statements of the College. Any difference between \nthe liability accrued by the College related to the claims and the amounts ultimately settled will \nbe recorded in the period in which the claim is resolved. \n(b) As at March 31, 2024, the College has issued two letters of credits as security for costs related \nto the Academic Building and Student Housing project to the City of New Westminster totaling \n$1,744,365 (2023 - nil) which expire on December 21, 2024 and January 14, 2025.

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province.

    "content": "VISION\n76\nWhile a vision directs an institution toward a future state, values are what \ndefine it. Sometimes overlooked, values play a key role in organizational \nculture. Values communicate what type of institution we are and how \nwe work. As times and institutions change, it is important to update and \nreflect upon an institution’s values. Last updated in 2010, feedback from \nthe College indicated that it was time to renew ours.\nThrough a college-wide survey and town-hall forums, we were able to \ndistill our values into five core areas:\nOur vision is where we are going and how we know when \nwe get there. From community feedback, the College’s \nprevious vision of combining the best aspects of an applied \nand academic experience continued to hold strong appeal. \nBut it was also seen as a statement of what we have already \nachieved rather than as an aspirational goal for the future.\nIt was clear that there was a strong desire for a more \ncompelling vision statement that reflected not just where \nthe college was today, but the kind of institution we wanted \nto become, and the kind of student we wanted to graduate.\nFeedback from surveys and town hall meetings suggested \nthat Douglas’s vision needed to reflect both the individual \ntransformative benefits of an education, as well as touch on \nthe societal benefits of a better educated population. After \nmuch reflection and discussion, a vision was crafted: \nTO GRADUATE RESILIENT \nGLOBAL CITIZENS WITH THE \nKNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO \nADAPT , INNOVATE AND LEAD \nIN A CHANGING WORLD. \nThis vision may lack the grandiose phraseology that finds \nits way into many strategic plans, which often claim to be \nthe most of one thing, the absolute best at another thing or \nthe world leader in something else, but it is very Douglas. \nIt is true to who we are. It focuses on our students. And it \nlooks toward an attainable, hopeful future. As one town hall \nparticipant noted: “Isn’t this the kind of citizen – the kind \nof people – the world needs right now?”\nHonesty and Integrity \nWe do the right thing. We treat each other with fairness and \nrespect, and we model ethical behaviour in our academic, \ninterpersonal and administrative practices. \nInnovation and Creativity \nWe challenge ourselves. We strive for excellence in our \nacademic programs, our teaching, our student and employee \nservices, and our administration. \nDiversity and Inclusion \nWe embrace uniqueness. We recognize, celebrate and \nsupport the cultural, ethnic, religious, physical and \nindividual diversity of our students and employees. \nAccountability and Sustainability \nWe take the long view. We uphold our responsibility as \ncareful stewards of the financial, physical and environmental \nresources entrusted to us.\nCommunity and Relationships \nWe care. We support each other and our community partners \nin our role to cultivate resilient global citizens and to \nadvance a more prosperous, just and fair society.  \nVALUES \nH&I\nI&C\nD&I\nA&S\nC&R",

We recognize that \nsuccess comes in many forms (e.g., educational attainment, personal development, \nlife goals, career advancement) and we considered what we could do to enhance \nexisting mechanisms to help students achieve their goals.  Two objectives emerged.   \nSUCCESSFUL  \nSTUDENTS\nI. Design and implement integrated service \nmodels that improve student satisfaction and \nstreamline processes. These changes will make \nit easier for students to get the information \nand services they need to progress in their \nstudies.\n \nII. Enhance participation in, availability of, \nand satisfaction for learning activities that \nhave experiential/applied elements. As a \nresult, more students will have more hands-on \nexperiences to enhance their learning\nIII. Expand the availability of open educational \nresources (OER) at the College to improve \naffordability and learning outcomes. This \nwill reduce textbook costs, making students’ \neducations more affordable and accessible. \nRecognize and build on comprehensive \nstudent skills and competencies.\nInitiatives under this objective will focus \non the holistic educational experience, by \nrecognizing that a college education extends \nbeyond the classroom and that learning can \ntake many forms.\nI. Develop ways to validate, record and \nrecognize applied skills acquired by students. \nFor example, by ensuring “soft skills” \nstudents acquire at Douglas are documented \nin a way that they can present to others.\nII. Expand and enhance access to \ncareer-related skills training to improve \nemployment prospects. For example, giving \nstudents more help with resume writing, \npublic speaking, and preparing for job \ninterviews.\n \nIII. Investigate and pilot new program \nopportunities. This may include adding \nprogramming styles not currently offered at \nDouglas, such as microcredentials.",

That’s \nquite a milestone, but it also means that some of our infrastructure \nhas been serving us for decades.  Although our facilities are well-\nmaintained, growing student demand, changing service needs, and \nnew technologies all continue to stretch College infrastructure to its \nlimits. Initiatives under this objective will aim to grow and improve \nCollege facilities, as well as look to new opportunities to enhance \nthe campus experience. Importantly, these initiatives will now have \nto be looked at through a new lens – pandemic responsiveness and \nmitigation – that will likely require long-term institutional flexibility.\nExpand and renew facilities.\nI. Build a new academic building to house new programs, \naccommodate growth in enrolments, and improve work and \nstudy spaces. The College already owns land adjacent to the \nexisting campus in New Westminster, where the new building \nwill be constructed.  \nII. Complete a business case for a student housing project \nthat would enhance the campus community and qualify for \ngovernment funding.  \nIII. Modernize existing classroom, collaboration, public and \nemployee spaces to a new college standard.  This will make \nCollege spaces more functional, comfortable, and inspiring.\nRESPONSIVE \nLEARNING  \nENVIRONMENTS\nThis theme focuses on the core College experience – the programs we teach and the \nlearning environments in which we teach them. The two key objectives under this \ntheme will help enhance the relevance and quality of programming, as well as improve \ncampus physical spaces to create safe, healthy, and effective environments for students \nand all employee groups. \nDevelop relevant and innovative programs.\nDouglas College programs are already known for their quality and relevance. But it’s vital to \nalways be on the lookout for new programs and to explore new delivery methods. Initiatives \nunder this objective will ensure the variety, quantity, and quality of programming at Douglas will \ncontinue to improve and keep pace with external demands.\nI. Design and offer educational programming \nthat recognizes global competencies. This \nmay include piloting a certificate program \nthat could be embedded within a bachelor’s \ndegree.\nII. Identify and initiate program renewal for \ntargeted programs to increase relevance for \nstudents and employers. This may result in \nchanges to program structures and learning \noutcomes, increasing students’ opportunities \nfor employment or further studies. \nIII. Review and optimize the number of \ncredentials offered at the College consistent \nwith student demand. The goal of this \ninitiative is to remove credentials that are “on",

With \ndirection from provincial and federal \ngovernments, this support has been \nexpanded to become a process of truth \nand reconciliation. Initiatives under this \nobjective aim to create an increasingly \nwelcoming campus environment for \nIndigenous students, faculty, and \nstaff, to build bridges to Indigenous \ncommunities, and to support the \ncreation of Indigenous curricula and \nprofessional development.\nTHEME 3 SOCIAL AND  \nENVIRONMENTAL  \nRESPONSIBILITY\nExpressions of care and concern for people and our planet are evident throughout \nDouglas College’s institutional values. But it is not enough to care—we also have to act. \nThe two objectives under this theme will help provide the guideposts needed to ensure \nthat our actions align with our values and continue to push us towards a more just and \nsustainable future.\nI. Express Douglas College’s \ncommitment to Indigenization and \nreconciliation in ways that are tangible \nand visible to our communities, our \nstudents, our employees and visitors. \nOur campuses should highlight \nIndigenous art and our operations \nshould demonstrate respect for \nIndigenous culture and history.  \nII. Deepen relationships with local \nFirst Nations in ways that serve their \ninterests and needs, and the needs \nand interests of Indigenous students \nat Douglas College. E.g. Build and \nmaintain bridges to Indigenous \ncommunity groups. \n \nIII. Support departments to develop \nIndigenous and culturally relevant/\ninformed offerings that reflect history \nand culture of Indigenous peoples. \nThese efforts will nurture the variety \nand type of Indigenous-informed \neducation we provide. \nIV. Continuous professional \ndevelopment for faculty and staff \non Indigenization, and continued \ndevelopment of employee resources.\nContribute to sustainability goals \nthrough education, processes and \npractices. \nAs a public post-secondary institution, \nDouglas College has a responsibility \nto provide environmental and social \nleadership. Initiatives under this \nobjective will help demonstrably reduce \nthe College’s environmental impact \nand support educational programming \nthat is socially and environmentally \nprogressive.\nI. Design and implement a climate \naction strategy that commits to \nreducing carbon emissions, energy \nusage and waste, and enhances \nDouglas College’s capacity to adapt \nto a changing climate.  \nII. Encourage the development of \ncurriculum that is responsive to \nenvironmental and social needs.  This \nmay result in entirely new programs \nor new course offerings within \nexisting programs.  \nIII. Review and revise college policies \nand practices to promote diversity \nand inclusion, eliminate systemic \nbiases, and support anti-racism \ninitiatives.",

Objectives in this theme will \nhelp align College values with College practices associated with health and wellness.  This \nincludes student and employee wellness, as well as long-term institutional viability.\nI. Create multi-year workforce plans for \nadministrative units to guide employee \nrecruitment, development, and succession \nplanning. This will be done by every \nadministrative unit to help the College plan \nfor the future. \nII. Develop a College-wide mental wellness \nstrategy for students, faculty, staff, and \nadministrators. This type of strategy will \nhelp the College gauge needs and develop \nappropriate plans.\nModernize business processes and \ndigital environments.\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, \ndigital transformation and adaptable \nbusiness process were becoming \nnecessary priorities for most \ninstitutions. The temporary shift to \nremote learning and working highlights \nhow important the digital experience \ncan be to the overall functioning and \nsuccess of the College. Initiatives under \nthis objective will focus on ensuring \nbusiness practices are adaptive to \nchanging institutional needs and digital \nexperiences are optimized to provide the \nbest user experiences for students and \nemployees.\nI. Optimize digital experiences across \nkey touchpoints, including the College’s \nwebsite, mobile app, and enterprise \nsystems. These changes will support all \nmembers of the College community by \nproviding better user experiences.\nII. Formalize and expand strategic \nenrolment management practices. This \nwill improve our ability to plan for growth, \nmeet enrolment targets, and adjust to \nshifts in student demand for courses and \nprograms. A cross-college committee will \nguide the process.  \nIII. Facilitate transition to a digital \nworkplace and take steps toward \nsmart campus systems. This may \ninclude creating tools and structures to \nenhance and improve work-from-home \nopportunities. \nIV. Create and support a cross-college \ndigital transformation team to champion \nand accelerate the adoption of appropriate \ndigital technologies and processes.",

    "content": "DO WHAT  \nYOU LOVE.\n1918\nTraditionally in a strategic plan, this is the space where we \nwould wrap things up with some high-level reiteration of the \ninstitution’s goals or vision. But we would be remiss to do so \nwithout mentioning the context in which the final stages of the \nplan have come together. As of this writing, virtually all classes \nat Douglas are being conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. Most of our employees are working from home. \nOur campuses are largely empty. Meanwhile, protests against \ncontinued systemic racism have erupted in major cities around \nthe world.  \nGiven these unprecedented circumstances, before we finalized \nthis plan we had to ask ourselves some challenging questions: \nIs it enough? Does it reflect our values? And is our vision \nhopeful and helpful given the current global situation? \nWhile the true test will come in five years as we reflect back on \nhow the College has changed, we believe the foundations laid \nin this document are strong. From our academic programming, \nto our relationships in the community, to our technologies \nand facilities, to how we address social and environmental \nissues, this plan provides us with a framework to make Douglas \nCollege an even better institution. In fact, our vision – to \ngraduate resilient global citizens with the knowledge and skills \nto adapt, innovate and lead in a changing world – seems even \nmore prescient now, and more important than ever. \nCONCLUSION",

Authority and purpose\nLang\nara College (the “College”) operates under the authority of the College and Institute Act of British\nColumbia. The College is a government not-for-profit entity governed by a Board of Governors, the majority of\nwhom are appointed by the Province of British Columbia. The College is a registered charity and is exempt from\nincome taxes under section 149 of the Income Tax Act.\nThe\n College provides university studies, career studies and continuing studies programs and courses to over 20,000\nfull and part-time students annually.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\n(a) B\nasis of accounting:\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23.1 of the Budget Transparency\nand Accountability Act of the Prov ince of British Columbia supplemen ted by Regulations 257/2010 a nd\n1\n98/2011 issued by the Province of British Columbia Treasury Board.\nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act requires  that the financial statements be prepared in\naccordance with the set of standards and guidelines that comprise generally accepted accounting principles for\nseni\nor governments in Canada, or if the Treasury Board makes a regulation, the set of standards and guidelines\nthat comprise generally accepted accounting principles fo r senior governments in Canada as modified by the\nalternate standard or guideline or part thereof adopted in the regulation.\nRegulation 257/2010 requires that all tax-payer su pported organizations adopt Canadian public sector\naccounting standards without any PS 4200 elections.\nRegulation 198/2011 \nrequires that restricted contributions received or receivable are to be reported as revenue\ndepending on the nature of the restrictions on the use of the funds by the contributors as follows:\n(i)Contributions for the purpose of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible capital asset or\ncontributions in the form of a depreciable tangibl e capital asset are recorded as deferred ca pital\ncont\nributions and recognized in revenue at the same rate that amortization of the related tangible capital\nasset is recorded. The reduction of deferred capital contributions and recognition of revenue is accounted\nfor in th\ne fiscal period in which the tangible capital asset is used to provide services.\n(ii) Co\nntributions restricted for specific purposes other than those for the acquisition or development of  a\ndep\nreciable tangible capital asset are recorded as deferred contributions and recognized in revenue in th e\ny\near in which the stipulations or restrictions on the contributions have been met.\nFo\nr British Columbia taxpayer-supported organizations, these contributions include government transfers\nand exte\nrnally restricted contributions.\nThe\n accounting policy requirements under Regulation 198/2011 are significantly different from th e\nrequ\nirements of Canadian public sector accounting standards which require that government transfers that\nd\no not contain a stipulation that creates a liability be recognized as revenue by the recipient when approved\nby the transferor and when the eligibility criteria have been met in accordance with public sector accounting \nstandard PS 3410. As a result, revenue recognized in the Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus\nand certain related deferred capital contributions woul d be recorded differently under Canadian public\nsector accounting standards.\n10",

    "content": "Langara College  \nNotes to the Financial Statements \nYear ended March 31, 2024 \n \n \n \n2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): \n(b) Financial instruments \nFinancial instruments are classified into two categories: fair value and amortized cost.  \n(i) Investments that are quoted in an active market are reflected at fair value as at the reporting date. Sales and \npurchases of investments are recorded on the trade date. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of such \ninvestments are recorded as an expe nse. Unrealized gains and losses on investments carried at fair value \nare recorded in the Statement of Remeasurement Gain s and Losses until such time as they are realized. \nRealized gains and losses on financial assets are transferred from the Statement of Remeasurement Gains \nand Losses and recognized in the Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus provided their use is \nnot restricted.  As at March 31, 2024, the College does not have any unrealized gains and losses and a \nStatement of Remeasurement Gains and Losses has not been included in these financial statements.  \n(ii) Investments with fixed maturity dates are recorded at  amortized cost unless designated as fair value. \nIncome on these investments is recognized in the Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus over \nthe period of time that the investments are held using the effective interest rate method. Sales and purchases \nof investments are recorded on the trade date. Transaction costs related to the acquisition of investments is \nincluded in the cost of the related investments.  The College has not designated any such instruments as \nfair value. \n(iii) The carrying amounts of other financial instruments, being accounts receivable, and accounts payable and \naccrued liabilities, approximate their fair value due to their short maturities.  The fair value of the College’s \nfixed rate long-term debt is impacted by changes in market yields, which can result in differences between \ncarrying value and fair value.  Based on management’s estimates, the fair value of the College’s long-term \ndebt at March 31, 2024, is not significantly different than its carrying value, as interest rates applicable to \nthe debt are not significantly different from interest rates in effect at the year-e nd date. The sinking fund \ninvestments related to the long-term debt are carried at fair value. \n(c) Inventories for resale \nInventories held for resale, including books and other materials, are recorded at the lower of cost or net \nrealizable value. Cost includes the original purchase cost, plus shipping and applicable duties. Net realizable \nvalue is the estimated selling price less any costs to sell. \n  \n11",

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): \n(d) Non-financial assets \nNon-financial assets are not available to discharge exis ting liabilities and are held for use in the provision of \nservices. They have useful lives extending beyond the current year and are not intended for sale in the ordinary \ncourse of operations. \n(i) Tangible capital assets \nTangible capital assets are recorded at cost, which includes amounts that are directly attributable to the \nacquisition, construction, development or betterment of the asset. The cost, less residual value, of the \ntangible capital assets, excluding land, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful \nlives shown below. Land is not amortized as it is deemed to have a permanent value. \n \nAssets under development are not amortized until the asset is available for productive use. \nTangible capital assets are written down to residual value when conditions indicate that they no longer \ncontribute to the provision of goods and services, or when the value of future economic benefits associated \nwith these assets is less than their net book value.   \n(e) Employee future benefits \nThe College and its employees make contributions to the College Pension Plan and the Municipal Pension \nPlan, which are multi-employer joint trusteed plans. These plans are defined benefit plans, providing a pension \non retirement based on the member’s age at retirement, length of service a nd highest earnings averaged over \nfive years. Inflation adjustments are contingent upon available funding. As the assets and liabilities of the plans \nare not segregated by institution, they are accounted for as defined contribution plans and contributions by the \nCollege to the plans are expensed as incurred. \nBenefits for sick leave, vacation and other leaves are also available to College employees. The costs of sick \nleave benefits and other leaves are actuarially determin ed based on service and best estimates of retirement \nages and expected future salary and wage increases. The obligation under these benefit plans are accrued based \non projected benefits as the employees render services necessary to earn the future benefits. Actuarial gains \nand losses are amortized over the employees’ average remaining service lifetime.  Vacation benefits are \nrecorded as a liability as earned. \n  \n12",

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): \n(f) Revenue recognition and deferred revenue \nTuition and student fees and sales of goods and services are reported as revenue at the time the services are \nprovided or the products are delivered, and collection is reasonably assured.  Tuition fees and other amounts \ncollected in advance of the delivery of related instru ction are accounted for as deferred revenue until the \nprograms are delivered. \nUnrestricted donations and grants are recorded as revenue when receivable if the amounts can be estimated and \ncollection is reasonably assured. Pledges from donors are recorded as revenue when payment is received or the \ntransfer of property is completed. \nRestricted donations and grants are reported as revenue depending on the nature of the restrictions on the use \nof the funds by the contributors, as follows: \n(i) Contributions for the purpose of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible capital asset or in the form \nof a depreciable tangible capital asset, for use in pr oviding services, are recorded as a deferred capital \ncontribution and recognized in revenue at the same rate that amortization of the tangible capital asset is \nrecorded. \n(ii) Contributions restricted for specific purposes, other than for those for the acquisition or development of a \ndepreciable tangible capital asset, are recorded as deferred contributions and recognized in revenue in the \nyear in which the stipulation or restriction on the contribution have been met.  \nInvestment income includes interest recorded on an accrual basis, realized gains and losses on the sale of \ninvestments, and write downs on investments where the loss in value is determined to be other than temporary. \n(g) Use of estimates \nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the reporting framework described in note 2(a) \nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Where actual results differ from these \nestimates and assumptions, the impact will be recorded in future periods when the difference becomes known. \n(h) Foreign currency translation \nThe College’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into \nCanadian dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities \ndenominated in foreign currency are reflected in the financial statements in equivalent Canadian dollars at the \nexchange rate in effect on the year-end date.  \n  \n13",

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): \n(i) Budget figures \nBudget figures have been provided for comparative purposes and have been derived from the Operations and \nCapital Budget approved by the Board of Governors of the College on March 23, 2023. The budget is reflected \nin the Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus and the Statement of Changes in Net Debt. \n(j) Contaminated sites \nContaminated sites are a result of contamination being introduced into air, soil, water, or sediment of a \nchemical, organic or radioactive material or live organism that exceeds an environmental standard. Liabilities \nare recorded net of any expected recoveries. \nA liability for remediation of contaminated sites is r ecognized when a site is not in productive use and an \nenvironmental standard exists, contamination exceeds the environmental standard, the College is directly \nresponsible or accepts responsibility, it is expected that future economic benefits will be given up, and a \nreasonable estimate of the amount can be made. The liab ility is recognized as management's estimate of the \ncosts directly attributable to remediation activities,  including the cost of post-remediation operation, \nmaintenance and monitoring that are an integral part of the remediation strategy for a contaminated site.  \nThe College has no contaminated sites as of March 31, 2024 or March 31, 2023. \n(k) Art collection \nThe cost of additions to the College’s collection are expensed in the year of acquisition. Proceeds from \ndeaccession from the collection are recorded as revenue in the year of disposition. \nThe College also receives donated works of art, the value of which is not reflected in these financial statements \ngiven the difficulty of determining the fair value. \n(l) Asset retirement obligation \nAn asset retirement obligation is recognized when, as at the financial reporting date, all of the following criteria \nare met: \n(i) There is a legal obligation to incur retirement costs in relation to a tangible capital asset; \n(ii) The past transaction or event giving rise to the liability has occurred; \n(iii) It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and  \n(iv) A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made. \nThe estimate of the asset retirement obligation includes co sts directly attributable to the asset retirement \nactivities and is recorded as a liability and increase to the related tangible capital assets. The amount capitalized \nin tangible capital assets is amortized using the amortization accounting policy outlined in note 2(d)(i).  \nThe carrying value of the liability is reevaluated at each financial reporting date with changes to the timing or \namount of the original estimate of cash flows recorded as an adjustment to the asset retirement obligation \nliability and tangible capital assets.  The excess of an adjustment over the carrying value of the related tangible \ncapital asset is recorded in the Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus. \n  \n14",

Sick leave credits accumulate to each employee as they render services to \nthe College; however, the accumulated amount does not vest and so is extinguished for each employee once \nthey are no longer employed by the College. The expected use of the accumulated amount is determined using \nactuarial valuation techniques and the corresponding liability is recorded by the College. An expense for sick \nleave is recognized in the period for which each employee earns this benefit.  \n(b) Other leaves that vest: \nCertain employee groups may be eligible to earn other time-off benefits that may accumulate for multiple years \nand vest with each qualifying employee.

Employee future benefits (continued): \n(c) Pension benefits: \nThe College and its employees contribute to the College Pension Plan and Municipal Pension Plan (jointly \ntrusteed pension plans). The boards of trustees for these plans, representing plan members and employers, are \nresponsible for administering the pension plans, including investment of assets and administration of benefits. \nThe plans are multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Basic pension benefits are based on a formula. As at \nAugust 31, 2023, the College Pension Plan has about 17,200 active members, and approximately 10,700 retired \nmembers. As at December 31, 2022, the Municipal Pens ion Plan has about 240,000 active members, including \napproximately 7,000 from colleges. \nEvery three years, an actuarial valuation is performed to assess the financial position of the plans and adequacy \nof plan funding. The actuary determines an appropriate combined employer and member contribution rate to fund \nthe plans. The actuary’s calculated contribution rate is based on the entry-age normal cost method, which produces \nthe long-term rate of member and employer contributions sufficient to provide benefits for average future entrants \nto the plans. This rate may be adjusted for the amortization of any actuarial funding surplus and will be adjusted \nfor the amortization of any unfunded actuarial liability. \nThe most recent actuarial valuation for the College Pension Plan as at August 31, 2021, indicated a $202 million \nsurplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.  \nThe most recent valuation for the M unicipal Pension Plan as at Decembe r 31,2021, indicated a $3,761 million \nfunding surplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.  \nThe College paid $9,322,843 (2023: $8,307,996) as employer contributions to the College Pension Plan and \n$2,139,423 (2023: $1,720,444) as employer contributions to the Municipal Pension Plan in the current year. \nThe next valuation for the College Pension Plan will be as at August 31, 2024, with results available in 2025.  The \nnext valuation for the Municipal Pension Plan will be December 31, 2024, with results available in 2025.  \nEmployers participating in the plans record their pension expense as the amount of employer contributions made \nduring the fiscal year (defined contribution pension plan  accounting). This is because the plans record accrued \nliabilities and accrued assets for each plan in aggregate, resulting in no consistent and reliable basis for allocating \nthe obligation, assets and cost to individual employers participating in the plans. \n  \n17",

Financial risk management \nThe College is exposed to risks of varying degrees of si gnificance from its use of financial instruments which \ncould affect its ability to achieve its strategic objectiv es. The Board of Governors ensures that the College has \nidentified its major risks and ensures that management monitors and manages them. \n(a) Liquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the College will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. \nThe College establishes budgets and cash flow projections  to ensure that it has the necessary funds to meet \nits obligations as they become due. \n(b) Market and interest rate risk \nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the College’s operating results. Interest rate \nrisk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of floating rate instruments will fluctuate due to changes \nin market interest rates. It is management’s opinion that the College is not exposed to excessive levels of \nmarket or interest rate risk arising from its financial instruments. \n(c) Credit risk \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the College if a client of the College or counterparty to a financial \ninstrument fails to meet their contractual obligations. Such risks arise principally from certain financial assets \nheld by the College consisting of cash, investments and accounts receivable. \nThe College’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of its clients, in \nthe event of non-payment of amounts owing. This risk is mitigated by ensuring that the majority of \nreceivables are collected prior to the delivery of programs, by the College’s prompt collection processes and \nby other remedies such as withholding of transcripts in the event of non-payment. \nThe College accounts for a specific bad debt provision when management considers that the expected \nrecovery is less than the amount receivable. \nThe College has deposited cash and holds investments with reputable financial institutions, from which \nmanagement believes the risk of loss is remote. \nThere has been no change to the risk exposures from 2023. \n14. Commitments \nThe College has entered into agreements relating to pr emises, vehicles, software and office equipment.  The \nminimum annual payments are as follows: \n \n  \nFiscal year\n2025 2,312,993              \n2026 1,710,690              \n2027 724,015                 \n4,747,698$          \n21",

Now more than ever, \nwe need to focus on building a prosperous, low-carbon, sustainable economy, and a province where \neveryone can find a good home in rural areas, in cities and in Indigenous communities. \nThis mandate letter, which I am sending in my capacity as Minister responsible for post-secondary \ninstitutions, sets out overarching principles relevant to the entire public sector and specific direction \nGovernment and public sector organizations must continue to advance results that people can see \nand feel in these key areas: strengthened health care, safer communities, attainable and secure \nhousing and a clean and fair economy that delivers affordability and prosperity.\nIn doing so, you will continue working towards lasting and meaningful Reconciliation by supporting \nopportunities for Indigenous Peoples to be full partners in the province we are \nbuilding together and delivering on specific commitments as outlined in the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples Act action plan.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province. CAS \ncan support you in public sector governance best practices, policy and planning. \nI expect you to ensure the important priorities and areas of focus listed in this letter are incorporated \ninto the practices of your institution and develop plans to address the following new priorities within \nyour approved budget and within the following context. \nPost-secondary education and training are fundamental for anyone who wishes to access and \nsucceed in most careers in our province. We know that 80 per cent of the 1 million new job openings \nin BC over the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. The StrongerBC \nFuture Ready Action Plan aims to make education and training more accessible, affordable and \nrelevant to prepare British Columbians for the jobs of tomorrow. Achieving the objectives of the \nAction Plan will require collaboration across many sectors, driven by the post-secondary sector.",

It builds \non the significant progress by Langara within our 2020 plan. \nThose achievements include:\n• a deepening relationship with Musqueam \n• academic program review, renewal, and development, which has supported significant enrolment growth and \nstrong financial performance \n• major improvements to our information technology infrastructure and systems \n• enhancements to business processes \n• the development of a new 25-year Campus Master Plan \n• our 49th anniversary celebration and first-ever comprehensive fundraising and alumni engagement campaign, \nBeyond 49\nSo much growth, change, and progress in a relatively short time brings new challenges. Adding to that, the global \nCOVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the post-secondary sector, including Langara’s students, employees, \nand the communities we serve. This new Strategic Plan seeks to address those challenges, while highlighting new \nopportunities. It sets out a vision of an institution that embraces Indigenization, celebrates its diversity, engages \nbroadly with the community and government in our students’ interests, and above all, provides relevant, accessible, \nhigh-quality learning experiences for our students, supporting the social and economic sustainability of the region.\nThis Strategic Plan is a complementary document to the new Academic Plan. Together they set the course for \nLangara over the coming five years.",

When I started at Langara a few years ago, I wasn’t sure what I was doing and if I would make it to grad. I \ndefinitely experienced some challenges along the way but appreciate all the help Langara provided me. It felt really good to be in a \nposition this past year to give back and help others by volunteering through VOLT.\nAs I enter the gowning room, I see so many smiling faces – friends and classmates, as excited as I am. I never expected I would \nmeet so many different kinds of people at college, but it enriched my experience at Langara.  As different as we all were from each \nother, with the culture at Langara, I always felt like I could just be myself. Before Langara I didn’t know much about the culture of \nthe local Coast Salish peoples, but having the opportunity to experience aspects of Musqueam culture on campus has helped me to \nbetter understand.\nAs I line up with my classmates to walk into convocation hall, I can’t help but reflect on everything I learned these past few years.  \nMy instructors were so knowledgeable and supportive. I accomplished things I didn’t think I could. I was able to get the classes I \nneeded, and the curriculum was really practical and relevant. I feel confident and excited to start third-year university now.   \nI am waiting now by the side of the stage for the Dean to call my name. I look out to the audience to see if I can spot any familiar \nfaces in the crowd and nearly miss my name being called. It’s finally time. I cross the stage, accept my diploma, have my photo with \nthe President, and get a hug from my favourite instructor, who is waiting for me at the far side of the stage. My friends, family, \nand instructors cheer me on, and my Dad embarrasses me by yelling my name too loudly. A bittersweet moment to cap off my \nLangara experience.\nI actually feel kind of sad to think I won’t be on campus anymore. The new A Building looks like it will be amazing when it is \ncomplete. But I am going to stay connected to the College. I will be back. I guess it is true what they say – once a student,  \nalways a Langaran.",

Our responsibilities under \nthose standards are further described in the  “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements ” \nsection of our auditor’s report.   \nWe are independent of the Entity in accordance with the ethic al requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial \nstatements in Canada and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \nEmphasis of Matter – Financial Reporting Framework \nWe draw attention to note 2(a) to the financial statements which describes the applicable financial reporting framework and \nthe significant differences between that financial reporting framework and Canadian public sector accounting standards.  \nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. \nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial \nStatements \nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the fi nancial statements in accordance with the financial reporting \nprovisions of Section 23.1 of the Budget  Transparency and Accountability Act of t he Province of British Columbia and for \nsuch internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the financial statem ents, management is responsible for assessing the Entity’s ability to continue as a going \nconcern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless \nmanagement either intends to liquidate the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Entity’s financial reporting process. \n2",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are\nrequired to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the fina ncial statements or, if such\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the\ndate of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going\nconcern.\n Communicate with those charged with governance regar ding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of\nthe audit and significant audit findings, including any significant  deficiencies in internal co ntrol that we identify during\nour audit.\n Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entit ies or business activities\nwithin the group entity to express an opinion on the financ ial statements. We are resp onsible for the direction,\nsupervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nChartered Professional Accountants \nVictoria, Canada \nJune 24, 202\n4 \n3",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \na) Basis of accounting \n \nBudget Transparency and Accountability Act \n \nThese Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23.1 of \nthe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act of the Province of British Columbia supplemented \nby certain regulations (257/2010 and 198/2011) issued by the Province of British Columbia \nTreasury Board.  \n \nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act  requires that the consolidated financial \nstatements be prepared in accordance with the set of standards and guidelines that comprise \ngenerally accepted accounting principles for senior governments in Canada, or if the Treasury \nBoard makes a regulation, th e set of standards and guidelines that comprise generally accepted \naccounting principles for senior governments in Canada as modified by the alternate standard or \nguideline or part thereof adopted in the regulation.   \n \nThe issued regulations require all ta xpayer supporte d organizations in the school, u niversity, \ncollege and hospital sectors to adopt Canadian public sector accounting standards without any \nPS4200 elections. \n \nThe regulations require that restricted contributions received,  or receivable are to be reported as \nrevenue depending on the nature of the restrictions on the use of the funds by the contributors as \nfollows: \n \n(i) Contributions for the purpose of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible \ncapital asset or contributions in the form of a depr eciable tangible capital asset are \nrecorded and, referred to as deferred capital contributions, recognized in revenue \nat the same rate that amortization of the related tangible capital asset is recorded. \nThe reduction of the deferred capital  contributions and the recognition of the \nrevenue are accounted for in the fiscal period during which the tangible capital asset \nis used to provide services. \n \n(ii) Contributions restricted for specific purposes other than those for the acquisition or \ndevelopment of a depreciable tangible capital asset are recorded as deferred \ncontributions and recognized in revenue in the year in which the stipulation or \nrestriction on the contributions have been met.  \n \nFor British Columbia taxpayer -supported organizations, these contributions include government \ntransfers and externally restricted contributions.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \na) Basis of accounting (continued)  \n \nPublic sector accounting standards \n \nThe accounting policy requirements under the Regulations are significantly different from the \nrequirements of Canadian public sector accounting standards which require that:  \n \n(i) Government transfers, which do not contain a stipulation that creates a liability, be \nrecognized as revenue by the recipient when approved by the transferor and certain \neligibility criteria have been met, and \n \n(ii) Externally restricted contributions be recognized as revenue in the period in which \nthe resources are used for the purpose or purposes specified. \n \nAs a result, revenue recognized in the Consolidated Sta tement of Operations and certain related \ndeferred capital contributions, would be recorded differently under Canadian public sector \naccounting standards. \n \nb) Basis of consolidation \n \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of \norganizations which are controlled by the University.  Inter -organizational transactions, balances \nand activities have been eliminated on consolidation. \n \nThe Royals Roads University Foundation, and Cascade Institute Research Society are controlled by \nthe University and fully consolidated in these financial statements.  \n \nThe Royal Roads University Foundation raise s funds to support Royal Roads University programs \nand initiatives. Cascade Institute is a Canadian research center that addresses the full range of \nhumanity’s converging environmental, economic, political, technological, and health crises.   \n \nc) Financial instruments \n \n(i) Cash and cash equivalents \n \nCash and cash equivalents include cash on- hand, demand deposits and short -term, highly \nliquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and that are subject \nto an insignificant risk of change in value. These short -term investments generally have a \nmaturity of three months or less at acquisition.  \n \n(ii) Investments \n \nThe University invests in short and long duration, fixed- term investments, publicly traded \nequities on a segregated basis (held directly), and pooled-fund products.   \n \nEquity and bond instruments that are quoted in an active market are reflected at fair value  \nas at the reporting date . All other financial instruments  are measured at cost or amortized \ncost.",

At the time of derecognition, \nthe related realized gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of \nOperations and related balances reversed from the Consolidated Statement of \nRemeasurement Gains and Losses . Unrealized gains and losses from the endowment \ninvestments, where earnings are restricted as to use, are recorded as deferred contributions, \nand recognized in revenue when disposed and when related expenses are incurred. \n \nInterest and dividends attributable to financial instruments are reported in the Consolidated \nStatement of Operations, except where amounts are required to be reflected in re stricted \ncontributions. Transaction costs are a component of cost for financial instruments measured \nusing cost and are expensed for financial instruments measured at fair value.  For financial \ninstruments measured using amortized cost, the effective inter est rate method is used to \ndetermine interest revenue or expense.  \n \nInvestments include operating and endowment investments.  Operating investments consist \nof research, capital and other funds received and held in advance for future expenditures.  \nEndowment investments consist of donations held in perpetuity to benefit current and future \ngenerations. \n \nThe Standards require an organization to classify fair value measurements using a fair value \nhierarchy, which includes three levels of information that may be used to measure fair value: \n• Level 1 -  Unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets \nor liabilities. \n• Level 2 -  Observable or corroborated inputs, other than Level 1, such as quoted \nprices for similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; and \n• Level 3 -  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and \nthat are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  \n \nd) Inventories held for sale \n \nInventories of merchandise held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  \n \ne) Non-financial assets \n \nNon-financial assets are not available to discharge existing liabilities  and are held for use in the \nprovision of services. They have useful lives extending beyond the current year and are not \nintended for sale in the ordinary course of operations. \n \n(i) Tangible capital assets \nTangible capital assets received as contributions are recorded at fair value at the date of \nreceipt if the fair value of the asset can be reasonably estimated. Contributions of tangible \ncapital assets where fair value cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded at a nominal \nvalue of $1.

These plans are defined benefit plans, \nproviding a pension on retirement, based on the member’s age at retirement, length of service, \nand highest earnings averaged over five years.  Inflation adjustments are contingent upon available \nfunding.  As the assets and liabilities of the plans are not segregated by institution, the plans are \naccounted for as a defined contribution plan and any contributions by the University to the plan \nare expensed as incurred. \n \nSick leave benefits are also available to the University’s employees.

Externally restricted amounts are to be used for \nthe purposes designated by the contributors (see note 6).  \n \nExternally restricted capital contributions for the improvement and acquisition of tangible capi tal \nassets are recorded as deferred capital contributions and recognized as earned revenue over the \nremaining useful life of the related tangible capital assets on the same basis as the related cost  \n(see note 7). \n \nGovernment operating grants that are not r estricted as to their use are recognized as revenue \nwhen receivable.  Such grants, if contributed for future periods, are reported as deferred \ncontributions until that future period.

These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of \nassets, liabilities, and related disclosures.  Key areas where management has made estimates and \nassumptions include those related to the carrying value of tangible capital assets, provisions for \nemployee future benefits and valuation of receivables.  Where actual results differ from these \nestimates and assumptions, the impact will be recorded in future per iods when the difference \nbecomes known. \n \ni) Budget figures \n \nBudget figures as approved by the University’s Board of Governors on March 31, 2023 have been \nprovided for comparative purposes. The budget is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of \nOperations as well as the Consolidated Statement of Change in Net  Debt. \nj) Adoption of new accounting standards \na. On April 1, 2023, the University adopted Can adian Public Sector Accounting Standard PS \n3160, Public Private Partnerships (“PS 3160”). The new accounting standard addresses \nthe recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of infrastructure procured by \npublic sector entities through certain types of public private partnership arrangements. \nManagement has assessed the impact of adopting PS 3160 and found that at present no \nsuch items meet the criteria to be recognized as a public private partnership.",

On April 1, 2023, the University adopted Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standard PS \n3400, Revenue (“PS 3400”). Under the new accounting standard, there are two categories \nof revenue –  exchange and non- exchange. If the transaction gives rise to one or more \nperformance obligations, it is an exchange transaction. If no performance obligations are \npresent, it is a non- exchange transaction. Management has assessed the impact of \nadopting PS 3400 on the consolidated financial statements of the University and has \nfound that there is no resulting impact to the consolidated financial sta tements. \n \nc. On April 1, 2023, the University adopted Public Sector Guideline PSG -8, Purchased \nIntangibles. PSG-8 defines purchased intangibles as identifiable nonmonetary economic \nresources without physical substance acquired through an arm’s length exchange  \ntransaction between knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion to act. \nIntangibles acquired through a transfer, contribution, or inter -entity transaction, are not \npurchased intangibles.

Employee Future Benefits (continued) \na) Pension benefits (continued) \nadministering benefits. The plans are multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Basic pension \nbenefits are based on a formula. As at August 31, 2023, the College Pension Plan has about 17,200 \nactive members, and approximately 10 ,700 retired members. As  at December 31, 20 22, the \nMunicipal Pension Plan has about 240,000 active members, including 7,000 from colleges.  \n \nEvery three years, an actuarial valuation is performed to assess the financial position of the plans \nand adequacy of plan funding. The actuary determines an appropriate combined employer and \nmember contribution rate to fund the plans. The actuary’s calculated contribution rate is based on \nthe entry-age normal cost method, which produces the long- term rate of member and employer \ncontributions sufficient to provide benefits for average future entrants to the plans. This rate may \nbe adjusted for the amortization of any actuarial funding surplus and will be adjusted for the \namortization of any unfunded actuarial liability.  \n \nThe most recent actuarial valuation for the College Pension Plan as at August 31, 2021, indicated a \n$202 million surplus for basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.  The most recent valuation \nfor the Municipal Pension Plan as at December 31, 2021, indicated a $3,761 million funding surplus \nfor basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.  \n \nThe University paid $ 3,841,649 for employer contributions to the plans in fiscal 202 4 (2023: \n$3,506,835).  \n \nThe next valuation for the College Pension Plan will be August 31, 2024.  The next valuation for the \nMunicipal Pension Plan will be December 31, 2024.  \n \nEmployers participating in the plans record their pension expense as the amount of employer \ncontributions made during the fiscal year (defined contribution pension plan accounting). This is \nbecause the plans record accrued liabilities and accrued assets for each plan in aggregate, resulting \nin no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligation, assets and cost to individual \nemployers participating in the plans. \n \nb) Accumulated sick leave benefit \n \nEmployees of the University are entitled to sick leave in accordance with the terms and conditions \nof their employment contracts . The University recognizes a liability and an  expense for sick leave \nin the period in which employees provide services.  Notwithstanding collective agreements that \nstate otherwise, accumulated sick leave benefits are not paid out for staff upon departure. The \nvaluation of accumulated sick leave benefi ts includes consideration of the current staff \naccumulated benefit entitlements adjusted for the expected utilization which is based on a n \naverage of the historic utilization rates. The accumulated sick leave benefit liability is shown in the \nfollowing table: \n  2024   2023 \n      \nAccrued employee future benefits, beginning of year $ 861,482  $ 921,095 \nNet change in current service costs  473   (59,613) \nAccrued employee future benefits, end of year $ 861,955  $ 861,482",

Commitments \na) Capital Asset Lease \n \nThe University leases the Royal Roads property and related assets and infrastructure from the \nGovernment of Canada for $1 per annum . This lease covers approximately 59.5 hectares and is for a \nterm of 50 years, commencing December 1, 2000 and terminating November 30, 2050, plus two \nrenewal options of 25 years and 24 years res pectively, for a total of 99 years.  The University also \nmanages the adjacent lands. The related memorandum of understanding covers approximately 169.34 \nhectares.  The initial term of five years commenced December 1, 2005.  The University subsequently \nre-negotiated the term for 25 years and has the option to renew for terms of five years each thereafter.  \nThe fair value of the property and related assets could not be reasonably estimated at the inception of \nthe lease and accordingly has been recorded in tangible capital assets at a nominal value of $1.  \n \nb) Contractual Obligations \n \nAs at March 31, 2024 , the University has capital commitments of $ 31.8M related to the Langford \nCampus construction and fit -up contracts (2023: $38M). The obligations will be paid out during  the \nfiscal year ended March 31, 2025. \n \n10. Contingent Assets and Liabilities \n \nThe University may, from time to time, be involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation that arise \nin the normal course of business. It is management’s opinion that the aggregate amount of any \npotential asset or liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the University’s financial \nposition or results. \n \n11.

Financial Risk Management \n \nThe University has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, \nmarket risk and liquidity risk. \n \na) Credit risk \nCredit risk is the  risk of  financial loss to the University if a customer fails to meet contractual \nobligations. Such risks arise principally from the amounts held by the University consisting of cash, \naccounts receivable and investments. The University closely monitors customer accounts to \nmitigate credit risk exposure. \n \nb) Market risk \nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, will affect the University’s \nincome. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial  instrument \nwill fluctuate because of changes in the market interest rates. Canadian market risk is managed by \ncontrolling risk exposures within acceptable parameters while optimizing investment returns (note 3) .    \n \nAs at March 31, 2024, had the market price of the investments increased or decreased by 1%, with \nall other variables held constant, investments would have increased or decreased, respectively by \napproximately $307,967 (2023 - $328,084).   This sensitivity analysis is based on the actual holdings \nas at March 31, 2024 and 2023.   Actual trading results may differ from this sensitivity analysis and \nthe difference could be material. \n \nc) Liquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is the risk that the University will not be able to meet its financial obligations  as they \nbecome due.  The University manages liquidity risk by continually monitoring actual and forecasted \ncash flows from operations, anticipated investing, and financial activities to ensure that its financial \nobligations are met. \n \nd) Currency risk \nCurrency risk is the risk that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect the University’s \nincome and market value of its investments . As at March 31, 2024 , if the Canadian dollar had \nstrengthened/weakened by 1% in relation to all other currencies, holding all other variable \nconstant, investments would have decreased/increased, by $ 132,075 (2023 - $139,685).   In \npractice, actual trading results may differ from this sensitivity analysis and the difference could be \nmaterial. \n \ne) Changes in financial risk \nThe University has not identified any changes in the financial risks over the prior year.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province. CAS \ncan support you in public sector governance best practices, policy and planning. \nI expect you to ensure the important priorities and areas of focus listed in this letter are incorporated \ninto the practices of your institution and develop plans to address the following new priorities within \nyour approved budget and within the following context. \nPost-secondary education and training are fundamental for anyone who wishes to access and \nsucceed in most careers in our province. We know that 80 per cent of the 1 million new job openings \nin BC over the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. The StrongerBC \nFuture Ready Action Plan aims to make education and training more accessible, affordable and \nrelevant to prepare British Columbians for the jobs of tomorrow. Achieving the objectives of the \nAction Plan will require collaboration across many sectors, driven by the post-secondary sector.",

    "content": "5 \nCurrent Challenges and Impacts  \nRoyal Roads is facing unprecedented challenges. Domestic and international enrolments are down sharply —\n11% in 2022/23 and 14% in 2023/24. While the University has reduced spending and sought additional sources \nof revenue to mitigate the decline in enrolment revenue, our budget is under considerable pressure resulting \nin an operating shortfall of $4.3M in 2023/24. For 2024/25 we are anticipating a further enrolment decline of \n7% resulting in an operating shortfall of $5.9M.  \n \nWe had anticipated a bounce-back in enrolments after COVID, but instead saw a significant decline. This is part \nof a larger trend —a great withdrawal of students —occurring at many institutions across the country. While it \nis difficult to fully understand what is driving reduced participation (something mirrored in other sectors as \nwell), it is often attributed to post-pandemic stress and burnout. We also know that students consider the \ntotal cost of education and that recent high inflation, and the resulting cost-of-living crisis, have led many \nprospective students to defer pursuing further education as they seek to manage the rising costs of essentials \nlike food, housing and transportation. Compounding this, labour shortages, higher wages and the concomitant \nrising opportunity cost of higher education, have further depressed demand. And there is evidence that \nemployers, facing tight organizational budgets, have significantly cut back on funding for professional \ndevelopment for their employees. At our campus, affordable housing remains a challenge as RRU does not \nhave year-round on-campus housing. Taken together these issues have had a disproportionately large impact \non enrolment at Royal Roads given our focus on programming for career professionals, the group most \naffected by these changes. This is occurring as we experience a rise in populism and anti-elite bias, expressed \nin the latest culture wars, leading to a marked decline in public support for and trust in post-secondary \ninstitutions.   \nWhile RRU has historically had a strong labour-\nmarket alignment, it is critical that we ensure \nour current program offerings continue to align \nwith, and respond to, labour-market needs. We \nare also facing increased competition from \nother public institutions that are responding to \ndemographic changes and shifting demand by \nfocusing on adult learners and professional \nprograms, and adopting online and blended \nformats, once the preserve of Royal Roads and \na handful of other institutions. \nFurthermore, in the last few years, private \ninstitutions have dramatically expanded \nenrolments, especially those of international students, by offering similar programs at a lower price and with \nlower entry requirements than those at Royal Roads. Those institutions offer quicker processing times, \neffective student-award strategies (in the form of upfront scholarships), and cutting-edge student and learning \nplatforms.",

    "content": "6 \nFurther complicating matters, the new federal immigration measures regarding international students, \nincluding increased requirements for financial self-sufficiency, reductions in the total numbers of international \nstudent visas, and restrictions on post-graduate work rights, have wreaked havoc on international student \nrecruitment and institutional revenues across the country, including here at Royal Roads. These changes \nfollow, and compound, the declines in student numbers caused by geopolitical tensions with countries like \nChina and India over the past few years.   \nWhile the collective impact of these disruptions is significant, even more significant is the impact of the \naccelerating democratization of knowledge. Simply put, knowledge—once the realm of post-secondary \ninstitutions—is now ubiquitous and increasingly available for free or at a very low cost, across multiple \nplatforms. This trend is accelerating dramatically with the rise of generative AI. With prospective students \nincreasingly able to access high quality content without needing to enroll in university programs, institutions \nneed to be clear on what they do and what they can offer that will add value. While larger universities, \nespecially those that are highly ranked and enjoy sizeable endowments and significant sources of ancillary \nrevenue, will weather these disruptions with variable degrees of success, small, special purpose universities \nlike Royal Roads will not survive unless they adapt quickly to the new environment.  \nAs we face these unprecedented challenges, we need to accelerate the work we’ve started to radically re-\nenvision the university —our structures, processes, platforms, programs, partnerships, and our culture —in \norder to more effectively realize our mandate which is to offer relevant applied and professional programs, \nrespond to the needs of the labour market, and serve the continuing education needs of the community.  \nA Re-engineered, Sustainable University   \nRoyal Roads needs more students to be sustainable. At present, RRU has some 2,040 student full time \nequivalents (FTEs). By 2027/28 we aim to have a total of 3,000 student FTEs (70 to 80% domestic/20 to 30% \ninternational; 80 to 90% graduate/10 to 20% undergraduate). We will continue with a primary focus on \ngraduate programming for professionals, including mid-career professionals and those at the beginning of \ntheir careers.  \nOur new undergraduate strategy will be fully \nimplemented, including degree completion \nand full-degree programming and student \nFTEs at RRU Langford. In 2025 the Langford \ncampus will open with initial offerings of four \nundergraduate certificates that provide \npathways into a BA Business Administration \nand a BSc Environmental Science, followed by \nother programming that will also provide \npathways to existing RRU undergraduate \nprograms.   \nWe will have grown the number of Indigenous \nstudents from 358 student FTEs in 2023/24 to \nat least 393 student FTEs by 2027/28 (a minimum 10% increase). The target for international students by \n2027/28 will be between 650 and 900 student FTEs, with an objective to attract international students from a \ngreater diversity of countries, enrolled in a wider range of programs. We will also aim to increase support for \nstudents by setting aside 2% of our institutional budget for financial assistance by 2027/28, on the way to a \nlong-term target of 3%.",

Our comprehensive Climate Action Plan will be \nexpanded to chart climate adaptation and resilience across all three campuses – Colwood, Langford and Salt \nSpring Island. The Climate Hub will be fully operational and serve as a centre for education, research, capacity \nbuilding and engagement. Our campus will feature rewilded spaces, honouring and restoring Indigenous \nrelationships with the land, while enhancing biodiversity and ecological health.   \nIn the context of ongoing negotiations \nfor anticipated treaty settlement lands \nwhere the campus sits, Royal Roads \nwill continue to work in partnership \nwith the Songhees and Esquimalt \nNations, leaning into beneficial \neconomic and educational \nopportunities, and implementing \ninitiatives or projects to support \nculture and the environment.

A dedicated advancement campaign will yield resources for additional Indigenous initiatives, as \nwell as support for Indigenous students. And a broad-based engagement strategy will ensure ongoing input \nfrom Indigenous voices and communities.  \n \nFinally, our budget will be balanced, and any operating surplus invested in a strategic investment fund.

RRU is a dedicated, committed and \nengaged community of changemakers with the skills required to navigate a rapidly changing environment and \ntake bold action to ensure long-term sustainability.   \nImplementation of the university’s People Plan will be well underway reflecting our commitment to lead with \ncourage, and advance equity and sustainability through the strategic pillars of Leadership Excellence; \nExceptional Employee Experience; Innovation & Effectiveness; and Inclusion, Community, & Wellbeing. These \nfour pillars will guide our efforts to create an environment where all members of our university community can \nthrive.  \nWe will continue to live the university’s values—caring, creative and courageous—which will be thoughtfully \ndeployed:  \n• courage to take risks and embrace far-reaching changes; \n• creativity to meet the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead; and \n• caring to build an inclusive community where everyone feels welcome and valued.   \nThere is, in other words, a strong culture of belonging.  \nBy 2027/28 there are many more people present on campus—students, staff, faculty and members of the \ncommunity—regularly engaging in events and activities, and using the services available.   \nWe are committed to creating more opportunities for our practices and processes to include diverse \nperspectives, adopting an intersectional approach that recognizes how power and privilege impact our \norganization. It's crucial we continue to embed a strong sense of belonging for our staff, faculty, and \ncommunity, fostering a culture where everyone can thrive in an environment that prioritizes wellbeing.   \nFinally, to create a workplace of choice, we are dedicated to engaging and listening to our employees, which \nincludes assessing and addressing the multiple barriers they may face to ensure our people feel valued and \nsupported.",

High quality business intelligence will consistently inform the work of marketing, recruitment, \nenrolment services, admissions, and student support. In addition, the university will have ready access to the \nlatest labour-market trends and a solid understanding of its competitors, particularly with respect to product \n(programs), price (tuition fees and financial assistance), processes (response and processing times), and \nservices for students.  \nWe will continue to adopt modern, integrated and interoperable digital platforms, including innovative \neducational technologies, to ensure optimal student experience and effective and efficient administration and \nmanagement. Processes, across the organization, especially those serving students, will be dramatically \nsimplified and largely automated, and will be harmonized and data-informed.

Our \nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the \nAudit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the College \nin accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these \nrequirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to \nprovide a basis for our opinion.  \nEmphasis of Matter \nWithout modifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2(a) to the consolidated financial  statements \nwhich describes the basis of accounting used in the preparation of these consolidated financial \nstatements and to Note 19 which describes the significant differences between such basis of accounting \nand Canadian public sector accounting standards. \nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial \nStatements  \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial \nstatements in accordance with Section 23.1 of the Budget Transparency and Accountability Act of the \nProvince of British Columbia, which requires Canadian public sector accounting standards modified by \nB.C. Regulation 198/2011 \"Restricted Contributions\", and for such internal control as management\ndetermines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the College’s \nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and \nusing the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the College \nor to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the College’s financial reporting process. \nTel:  250 763 6700\nFax:  250 763 4457 \nToll-free: 800 928 3307 \nwww.bdo.ca  \nBDO Canada LLP\n1631 Dickson Avenue, Suite 400 \nKelowna, BC  V1Y 0B5  Canada \nBDO Canada LLP, a Canadian limited liability partnership, is a member of BDO International Limited, a UK District limited by gu arantee, and forms part of the international \nBDO network of independent member firms.",

    "content": "Page 3\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements \nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s \nreport that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee \nthat an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always \ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence \nthe economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  \n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,\nand obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nThe risk of not detecting a mater ial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one\nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevan t to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the College’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used  and the reasonableness of accounting\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting\nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncerta inty exists related to\nevents or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the College’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw\nattention in our auditor’s report to the related  disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are\nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future\nevents or conditions may cause the Board to cease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial\nstatements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements\nrepresent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned \nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant de ficiencies in \ninternal control that we identify during our audit.  \nChartered Professional Accountants \nKelowna, British Columbia \nMay 13, 2024",

Your leadership in advancing and protecting the public \ninterest strengthens trust in public institutions.\nYou are serving British Columbians at a time when people in our province continue to recover from \nand respond to the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, an ongoing toxic drug crisis, \nclimate-related natural disasters and while global inflation is driving up costs. Now more than ever, \nwe need to focus on building a prosperous, low-carbon, sustainable economy, and a province where \neveryone can find a good home in rural areas, in cities and in Indigenous communities. \nThis mandate letter, which I am sending in my capacity as Minister responsible for post-secondary \ninstitutions, sets out overarching principles relevant to the entire public sector and specific direction \nGovernment and public sector organizations must continue to advance results that people can see \nand feel in these key areas: strengthened health care, safer communities, attainable and secure \nhousing and a clean and fair economy that delivers affordability and prosperity.\nIn doing so, you will continue working towards lasting and meaningful Reconciliation by supporting \nopportunities for Indigenous Peoples to be full partners in the province we are \nbuilding together and delivering on specific commitments as outlined in the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples Act action plan.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices.

These early \nadjustments have realized considerable cost-savings for the \nuniversity, which helped reduce our projected deficit. We are \ngrateful to the SFU community for their support as we work \nto ensure SFU’s long-term sustainability. \n SFU's long-term financial outlook continues to remain \nstable.

    "content": "10   Management Discussion and Analysis\nABOUT SFU\nSimon Fraser University (the university, SFU) is a \npost-secondary institution with campuses in Burnaby , \nVancouver and Surrey , British Columbia. The university \noperates under the University Act of British Columbia and \nin accordance with the mandate provided by the Ministry \nof Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills (the \nMinistry).  SFU is governed by the Board of Governors, the \nmajority of which are appointed by the Province of British \nColumbia, and the academic governance of SFU is vested \nin the Senate. The university operates under the mandate \nprovided by the Ministry .   \nSFU is a comprehensive university that offers a wide range of \nundergraduate, graduate and continuing education programs. \nThe university is focused on the pursuit of its academic and \nresearch missions which are outputs of the university's \nlong-term strategic plan outlined in What's Next: The SFU \nStrategy. The university has established a new budget model \nthat is more connected to its academic mission. Multi-\nyear projections have been prepared to assess long-term \nfinancial sustainability. This revised planning process brings \nenhanced financial scrutiny , investment in systems, ongoing \nsavings and efficiency and stronger reporting and oversight \nto support an excellent teaching, research, learning and \nwork environment. The annual budget process informed by \nWhat’s Next: The SFU Strategy works within the mandates \nestablished by the Province of British Columbia.  The process \nculminates in the submission of the budget to the Board of \nGovernors for approval prior to the start of the new fiscal year.  \nAdditional information can be found in SFU’s fiscal 2024–25 \nBudget and Financial Plan.\nCONTEXT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY\nSFU is part of the Government Reporting Entity (GRE) of \nthe Province of British Columbia, and as such, is required \nto present its financial statements on the same basis as \nthe provincial government.  Those standards are based on \nCanadian Public Sector Accounting Standards (PSAS) issued \nby the Public Sector Accounting Board of Canada (PSAB) as \ndescribed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nThe Ministry requires SFU to maintain a balanced budget and \nthe university may not take on additional debt without the \napproval of the Ministry .\nThe university is committed to financial accountability, and \nallocating and utilizing resources based on the university’s \nstrategic priorities. Empowerment of university personnel is \nkey to achieving financial targets. Personnel are provided with \naccessible, reliable and relevant information, as well as are \nequipped with business processes and financial transaction \nprocedures to effectively manage finances. Internal controls, \nestablished by management in the context of their roles, \nsupports internal oversight and accountability structures in \nplace to support assurance of reliable and effective financial \noperations and financial reporting.\nCautionary note on forward-looking statements\nSome statements in this Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) are forward-looking statements, based on \nassumptions and addressing future events and conditions, and by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results \ncould differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on \nany forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from expectations include, but are not \nlimited to the performance of financial markets, interest rate fluctuations, changes in legislation and regulations, the effects of \ncompetition, and business continuity risks.

    "content": "Management Discussion and Analysis    11\nOPERATING ENVIRONMENT\nPost-secondary education is an increasingly competitive \nsector where universities compete to attract top students, \nfaculty and staff from around the world.  The majority of \nSFU’s revenue is earned by delivering on its core academic \nmission which results in tuition revenue from domestic and \ninternational students along with an operating grant from \nthe Province of British Columbia.    \nThe Province of British Columbia has mandated that annual \ntuition increases for domestic students are capped at 2%.  \nTuition rates for international students are determined by \nthe global supply and demand for education. The Provincial \noperating grant is for credit courses for eligible students \nthat the Ministry sets targets for (Full Time Equivalent \ndomestic undergraduate and graduate students including \nco-op students). In January 2024, the federal government \nannounced a cap on international student visa permits \nfor a period of two years.  The full implications of these \nrestrictions remain uncertain.\nExpanding research and related services is one of SFU’s core \npriorities.  SFU faculty members, supported by the university, \ncompete for research funding with other post-secondary \ninstitutions.  The level of research funding received each year \ncan vary considerably depending on the research priorities of \nsponsors and the success rate of SFU’s research proposals.  \nSFU offers a range of ancillary services to enhance the student \nexperience, such as student housing, dining and parking that \nprovide additional revenue sources for the university.  The \nuniversity receives funds from donors and corporations to \nsupport activities such as funding bursaries and scholarships, \nor specific projects which are considered restricted as those \nfunds may only be used for the purposes outlined by the \ncontributor.  SFU maintains an endowment fund where \ndonors can make contributions that are invested in perpetuity \nto support programs and activities within the university.  \nEach year, a portion of the income earned on endowment \nfunds is made available for spending with the residual being \nmaintained in the endowment fund to support future growth.  \nThe Annual Surplus has two components, namely the surplus \nor deficiency of annual revenues over expenses from all \nactivities related to academic program delivery , research and \ncommunity engagement, which is reported as the Annual \nSurplus/Deficit from Operations (unrestricted surplus) and \nNet Restricted Endowment Contributions (restricted surplus) \nwhich increase SFU’s endowment fund. \nManagement may allocate a portion of the unrestricted \nsurplus toward the acquisition and renewal of capital assets \nwhich is recognized in the Investment in Tangible Capital \nAssets portion of Net Assets.  The costs of building and \nmaintaining physical assets is significant, SFU does not \ngenerate sufficient unrestricted surplus to fund large capital \nprojects on its own. When SFU constructs a new building, \nSFU will contribute a portion of the funding along with a \ncombination of funding sources including provincial and \nfederal governments, and corporate and non-corporate \ndonors.  The Ministry also provides an annual grant, that \nis combined with funds from SFU, to complete deferred \nmaintenance projects.\nSFU maintains cash and liquid assets to meet short-term \nobligations such as operating expenses and planned capital \nexpenditures.

Annual Surplus/Deficit from Operations\nSFU strives to generate sufficient revenue to fund operating \ncommitments for academic program delivery and university \nadministration, as well as research, community engagement \nand strategic initiatives. In surplus years, excess funds \nare allocated to support operational improvements and \ninfrastructure renewal that is essential for the university to \nachieve its vision.\nIn fiscal 2024, the university realized an Annual Deficit \nfrom Operations of $5 million compared to a surplus \nof $22.2 million in fiscal 2023. To ensure long-term \nfinancial sustainability and a balanced budget, SFU has \nimplemented several cost-saving measures, including \nbudget reductions within each portfolio area and faculty, \nan administrative hiring freeze and restructuring areas \nof the university’s operations to increase efficiency and \nreduce duplication. The annual deficit from operations \nincludes an accrual for restructuring initiatives approved \nby the Board. SFU also continues to explore new forms of \nrevenue generation and efficiencies and to strategically \nallocate resources to ensure our institution's long-term \nfinancial stability and growth. These measures helped \nto reduce the projected year-end deficit from previous \nprojections. Expenses grew 12.3% outpacing revenue \ngrowth of 9%. The university’s revenue growth has been \nnegatively impacted by declining international enrolments \nand losses on divestments from fossil fuels, while high \ninflation has contributed to increasing operating expenses.  \nThe Annual Deficit from Operations is driven by $21 million \nand $4 million net deficits in the Operating fund and Ancillary \nfunds respectively . This was mitigated by surpluses of $3 \nmillion in Specific Purpose and Internal Research, as well \nas $17 million in the Capital fund. The surplus in the Capital \nfund is primarily driven by transfers from Operating and \nAncillary funds, which are allocated to cover costs for crucial \ninfrastructure and deferred maintenance projects aimed at \nsustaining support for students and faculty. \nThe cost-saving measures implemented in fiscal 2024 will \nensure financial stability and a balanced financial position in \nthe future. \n \nFINANCIAL HEALTH OVERVIEW\nAnnual Operating Results by Fund\nAnnual Surplus/Deficit from Operations\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n60 M\n50 M\n40 M\n30 M\n20 M\n10 M\n0 M\n(10 M)\nOperating Ancillary Internal \nResearch\nSpecific\nPurpose\nCapital\n20 M\n15 M\n10 M\n5 M\n0 M\n5 M\n(10 M)\n(15 M)\n(20 M)\n(25 M)\n20242023",

These grants and contracts \nare critical to the university’s financial health as they \nincrease the university’s impact by supporting research and \nother initiatives, that would otherwise need to be funded \nthrough SFU’s limited unrestricted operating funding. SFU \nhad higher sales of goods and services as the university \nwelcomed more students to live on campus with the \ncompletion of a student housing project and more in-person \nactivity on campus.   \nThe Provincial operating grant and tuition are the primary \nsources of revenue for delivering credit courses and \nadministration, and accounted for 71% of SFU’s revenues in \nfiscal 2024.\nSFU reported investment income of $21 million in fiscal \n2024 including a $20 million loss from the settlement of \nfixed income investments as the university continues its \ncommitment to divest from fossil fuels. This divestment \nloss is a one-time loss and does not impact the on-going \noperations of the university.\nRevenue growth and diversification is essential to ensure \nthat the university can fund its operating expenses and \ngenerate a surplus in support of future initiatives. With \nthe softening of international enrolments, the university is \nmoving forward on several revenue-generating initiatives \nincluding a refreshed international recruitment strategy and \nan institutional international strategy to better coordinate \ninternational research, engagement, advancement and \nrecruitment activities.

When revenue falls \nshort of expectations, the university can respond by reducing \ncertain activities or by deferring discretionary expenditures. \nTo manage rising expenses, the university implemented \nseveral cost-saving measures, including fiscal restraint \nacross all units and an administrative hiring freeze.  \nExpense grew 12.3% from the previous year, exceeding \nthe rate of revenue growth. Salaries increased as a result \nof salary settlements negotiated under the current Public \nSector Bargaining Mandates & Agreements, general wage \nincreases, and progression through the ranks. Employee \nbenefits increased 25.0% in fiscal 2024 reflecting increases to \nhealth care premiums and increased costs of providing post-\nemployment benefit programs as the result of wage increases. \nSalaries and employee benefits comprise approximately 68% of \nexpenses, and have increased 18% from the prior year. \nNon-salary related expenses increased slightly by 2.7%, \nin part due to rising inflation and higher professional fees \nand contracted services. The increase was mitigated by a \nreduction in supplies and other operating expense as the \nuniversity implemented cost-saving measures to reduce the \noperating deficit.  \nExpenses by Fiscal Year\nDollars in Millions 2024 2023\nSalaries  563.1  484.2 \nEmployee Benefits  101.0  80.8 \nSupplies and Other Operational \nExpense\n 71.6  77.7 \nAmortization of Tangible Capital \nAssets\n 76.6  79.2 \nProfessional Fees and \nContracted Services\n 67.1  59.0 \nScholarships and Bursaries  54.4  51.1 \nTravel and Personnel  18.9  15.6 \nCost of Goods Sold  2.5  2.6 \nInterest on Debt  11.2  9.2 \nUtilities  14.0  13.5 \nTotal  980.4  872.9 \nYear-over-year growth 12.3% 4.9%\nTuition revenue remained flat in fiscal 2024 as tuition \nincreases were offset by declining international enrolments.  \nSFU has consistently exceeded the Province of British \nColumbia’s domestic enrolment targets. While domestic \nstudent numbers have grown in recent years, international \nenrolments have fallen, largely due to geopolitical events. \nIt is anticipated that demand for domestic enrolments will \ncontinue to be strong as job growth in British Columbia is \nexpected to be robust over the next 10 years and many of \nthese new jobs will require post-secondary education or \ntraining. SFU is strategically directing its future growth \ntowards programs that align with the Ministry’s mandate, \nincluding planning and preparing for a new medical program.\nInternational enrolments at SFU peaked in fiscal 2021 \nand have declined in the subsequent years as a result of \nthe pandemic and other geopolitical events. Historically , \nthe university has been effective at attracting and \nretaining international undergraduate students due to \nthe high global demand for university education, SFU’s \ninternational reputation and the desirable location of \nMetro Vancouver.  The onset of the pandemic softened \nthe demand for international education. Geopolitical \nevents have created uncertainty and have contributed \nto escalating inflation that has increased the costs of \nstudying abroad for international students. The federal \nannouncements concerning a cap on international student \nvisa permits may introduce additional challenges. The full \nimplications of these restrictions remain uncertain. As \na result, international enrolment is expected to continue \nto track lower than previous years but SFU is moving \nforward on several revenue-generating initiatives including \na refreshed international recruitment strategy and an \ninstitutional international strategy to better coordinate \nall international research, engagement, advancement and \nrecruitment activities.\nCredit Tuition Revenue by Type\nUndergraduate Domestic Undergraduate International\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n$160 M\n$140 M\n$120 M\n$100 M\n$80 M\n$60 M\n$40 M\n$20 M\n$0 M\nGraduate All",

Financial markets have been unusually volatile \nover the past few years, however during fiscal 2024 many \nasset classes experienced gains, while at the same time \ninflation increased substantially . The university did not \nincur additional debt in 2024.  \nEmployee Benefits\nSFU offers a range of post-employment benefit plans for \ncurrent faculty and staff, including pension plans for the \nAdministrative/Union Staff and additional non-pension \nretiree benefits, early retirement benefits and long-term \ndisability benefits. These plans create obligations for the \nuniversity to meet future funding commitments. Plan \nexpenses recognized in the Consolidated Statement of \nOperations are impacted by actuarial valuations and can \nvary considerably from year-to-year. The total expense to \nprovide these benefits in fiscal 2024 was $32.5 million, an \nincrease from $24.9 million in the prior year.  \nThe university administers formula retirement benefit \n(FRB) plans for administrative staff and for certain \nretired faculty members. On an annual basis, the actuary \ndetermines the annual accounting expense which is based \non the annual service cost to support faculty and staff \nmembers and actuarial gains and losses for the year.  The \nexpenses for these plans increased by $9.3 million from the \nprior year.  \n3. Long-Term Obligations\nAn important indication of financial health is the ability to \nmeet long-term obligations.

Our responsibilities\nunder those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements section of this report.  We are independent of the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the\nethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada and we have fulfilled our\nother ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nEmphasis of Matter – Basis of Accounting\nWe draw attention to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements which describes the basis of accounting.  The\nconsolidated financial statements are prepared in order for the Consolidated Entity to meet the reporting\nrequirements of the Act referred to above.  Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discloses the impact\nof these differences between such basis of accounting and Canadian public sector accounting standards. Our opinion\nis not modified in respect of this matter.\nOther Information\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information, other than\nthe consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, included in the Annual Report.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of\nassurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other\ninformation identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with\nthe consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially\nmisstated.\nWe obtained the Annual Report prior to the date of this auditor’s report. If, based on the work we have performed\non this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are\nrequired to report that fact in this auditor’s report. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Act,\nand for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\nBDO Canada LLP , a Canadian limited liability partnership, is a member of BDO International Limited, a UK company limited by \nguarantee, and forms part of the international BDO network of independent member firms.",

    "content": "26   Financial Statements\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Consolidated\nEntity’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Consolidated Entity, or to\ncease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Entity’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole\nare free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in\naccordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when\nit exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,\nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional\njudgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  We also:\n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due\nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence\nthat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion,\nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances. But not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Consolidated Entity’s internal control.\n Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates\nand related disclosures made by management.\n Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that\nmay cast significant doubt on the Consolidated Entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude\nthat a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our\nopinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.\nHowever future events or conditions may cause the Consolidated Entity to cease to continue as a going\nconcern.\n Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business\nactivities within the Consolidated Entity to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Consolidated Entity audit. We remain\nsolely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing\nof the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify\nduring our audit.\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, British Columbia\nMay 24, 2024",

Authority and purpose\nSimon Fraser University (the university) operates under the \nauthority of the University Act of British Columbia. It is a \ncomprehensive research university engaged in research and \ndelivering a full range of Undergraduate, Graduate and Lifelong \nLearning programs from campuses in Burnaby , Vancouver and \nSurrey , BC. Simon Fraser University is a not-for-profit entity \ngoverned by a Board of Governors, the majority of whom are \nappointed by the Province of British Columbia. The academic \ngovernance of the university is vested in its Senate. The \nuniversity is a registered charity and is exempt from income \ntaxes under section 149 of the Income Tax Act.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\na. Basis of accounting\nFinancial Reporting Framework\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in \naccordance with section 23.1 of the Budget Transparency and \nAccountability Act of the Province of British Columbia and the \nRestricted Contribution Regulation 198/2011 issued pursuant \nto it; the Financial Reporting Framework (FRF).\nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act requires \nthat the consolidated financial statements be prepared \nin accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting \nStandards (PSAS) except as modified by regulation 198/2011. \nThe regulation requires that contributions received or \nreceivable by the university for the purpose of acquiring \nor developing a depreciable tangible capital asset or \ncontributions in the form of a depreciable tangible capital \nasset are to be accounted for as deferred capital contributions \nas described in note 2c(v). Note 17c summarizes the impact of \nFRF versus PSAS on the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue recognized in the Consolidated Statement of \nOperations and certain related deferred capital contributions \nare recorded differently under FRF as described herein than \nunder PSAS.\nb. Basis of consolidation  \nConsolidated entities \nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, \nliabilities, revenues and expenses of organizations that are \ncontrolled by the university. Other controlled organizations \nare consolidated or proportionately consolidated and inter-\norganizational transactions, balances and activities have been \neliminated on consolidation.\nThe following organizations are consolidated or \nproportionately consolidated in the financial statements to  \nthe degree of interest in each:\n• Consolidation: SFU Foundation (100%); SFU Community \nCorporation (100%); and SF Univentures Corporation (100%).\n• Proportionate consolidation: Western Canadian Universities \nMarine Sciences Society (20% interest); I-INC Foundation \n(25% interest); and Civic Innovation Lab (50% interest).\nInvestment in government business enterprises \nGovernment business enterprises are accounted for by the \nmodified equity method. Under this method, the university’s \ninvestment in the business enterprise and its net income and \nother changes in equity are recorded as earned. No adjustment \nis made to conform the accounting policies of the government \nbusiness enterprise to those of the university. Other \ncomprehensive income is accounted for as an adjustment to \nnet assets of the university. Inter-organizational transactions \nand balances have not been eliminated, except for any profit \nor loss on transactions involving assets that continue to be \ncontrolled by the university.\nThe following organizations are government business \nenterprises and are accounted for by the modified equity \nmethod. These entities have fiscal years ending December \n31 and adjustments are made to recognize any significant \ntransactions between their fiscal year end and the university’s \nMarch 31 fiscal year end.\n• SFU Community Trust (SFUCT) (100% interest).\n• Great Northern Way Campus Trust (GNWCT) (25% interest).",

The university retains several external \ninvestment management firms to invest funds in accordance \nwith its investment policies, utilizing diverse agreed upon \ninvestment strategies primarily in active trading markets. \nThe fair value hierarchy for fair value measurements \nprovides an indication of the overall types of investments \nheld at March 31, 2024: 95% quoted prices in active markets \nfor identical investments (level 1) and 5% inputs that are not \nobservable market data (level 3).\nDerivatives\nThe university may enter into interest rate and foreign \ncurrency derivative contracts those expose the university \nto the risk of default by swap counter parties. This risk is \nmitigated by limiting exposure to derivative counter parties to \nhighly rated financial institutions.

Liquidity risk also includes the risk of the university \nnot being able to liquidate assets in a timely manner at a \nreasonable price.\nThe university meets its liquidity requirements by holding \nassets that can be readily converted into cash and preparing \nannual operating and capital expenditure budgets, which are \nmonitored and updated as required. In addition, the university \nrequires that funding for significant capital projects be secured \nbefore expenditures are incurred.\nMarket risk \nMarket risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument \nwill fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether \nthose changes are caused by factors specific to the individual \nfinancial instrument or factors affecting financial instruments \ntraded in the market. The significant market risks to which the \nuniversity is exposed are foreign exchange risk, interest rate \nrisk and other price risk.\nForeign exchange risk \nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the fair value of \nfinancial instruments or future cash flows associated with \nthe instruments will fluctuate in Canadian dollar value due to \nchanges in foreign exchange rates.\nThe functional currency of the university is the Canadian \ndollar. The university transacts some revenue and expenditure \nactivity in U.S. dollars and other currencies due to certain \noperating costs being denominated in U.S. dollars and other \ncurrencies. These transactions represent a small value of total \ntransactions, resulting in minimal risk.\nThe university uses foreign exchange forward contracts \nonly as a defensive strategy for any significant known \nfuture obligations to manage foreign exchange transaction \nexposures. There were no forward contracts outstanding at \nMarch 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.\nInterest rate risk \nInterest rate risk refers to the risk that the fair value of \nfinancial instruments or future cash flows associated with \nthe instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market \ninterest rates.\nThe interest rate exposure of the university arises from its \nfixed income investments including bonds and debentures.\nThe university’s cash and cash equivalents include amounts \non deposit that earn interest at market rates. The university \nmanages its exposure to interest rate risk on cash in order to \nmaximize the interest income earned on funds available for \ninvestment while maintaining the liquidity at levels necessary \nto conduct operations on a day-to-day basis. Fluctuations \nin market rates of interest on cash do not have a significant \nimpact on the university’s results of operations.\nThe primary objective of the university with respect to its \ninvestments in fixed income investments is to ensure the \nsecurity of principal amounts invested and provide for \na high degree of liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory \ninvestment return.\nOther price risk \nOther price risk refers to the risk that the fair value of \nfinancial instruments or future cash flows associated with \nthe instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market \nprices (other than those arising from foreign exchange risk \nor interest rate risk). The university is exposed to price risk \nthrough its investment in equities, hedge funds and real \nestate. The price risk associated with bonds is considered as \npart of interest rate risk for these purposes.\nCash and cash equivalents are demand deposits in Schedule 1 \nCanadian chartered banks, held primarily in Canadian currency , \nand are presented net of outstanding items including cheques \n5.

Certain non-SFUFA \nmembers of the academic staff chose not to enroll in the \nCollege Pension Plan at that time, and remain active members \nof the Academic Plan. The academic plan was closed to new \nmembers as of July 1, 2021.\nAs a condition of joining the College Pension Plan, the \nuniversity is required to pay transition costs as determined by \nthe College Pension Plan’s actuaries. At the time of joining, \nthe actuarially determined present value of future cash flows \nwas $44.1 million. The university recognized the liability in its \naccounts payable and accrued liabilities (note 10). Under the \nterms of a collective agreement, SFUFA members are required \nto reimburse the university for SFU’s portion of the transition \ncosts attributed to SFUFA members through a cost sharing \narrangement which is recognized as a receivable. Non-\nSFUFA members reimburse the university for SFU’s portion of \ntransition costs attributable to them directly .\nAccounting policy  \nThe university accounts for the Administrative/Union \nPlan and the FRB portion of the Academic Plan using \ndefined benefit method of accounting. The non-FRB \nportion of the Academic Plan and SFU’s participation in the \nCollege Pension Plan are accounted for using the defined \ncontribution method of accounting. The College Pension \nPlan is multi-employer joint trustee pension plan, providing \na pension on retirement based on the member’s age at \nretirement, length of service and highest earnings averaged \nover five years. Inflation adjustments are contingent \nupon available funding. As the assets of the plan are not \nsegregated by institution, the plan is accounted for as \ndefined contribution plan and any contributions of the \nuniversity are expensed as incurred.\nFor the plans accounted for as defined benefit plans, the \ndefined benefit FRB pension obligations and cost of pension \nbenefits earned by employees in the plans are recognized \nusing annual accounting valuations from each of the \nplans’ tri-annual actuarial funding valuations. A variety \nof assumptions factor into the results including expected \ninvestment performance, inflation rates, compensation \nlevels, retirement age and life expectancy . The resulting \nactuarial gains and losses arising from changes in \nassumptions are amortized over the Expected Average \nRemaining Service Lifetime (EARSL) of active employees \nfor the Administrative/Union Plan and Average Remaining \nPension Payment Period for the Academic FRB plan.\nActuarial valuations are required by the B.C. Pension \nBenefits Standards Act (PBSA) for each of the defined benefit \nFRB Plans at intervals of not more than three years. Such \nvaluations determine the employer contribution rate necessary \nto provide adequate funding of the plan liabilities. The \nvaluations are prepared using the projected unit cost method, \npro-rated on service. The Plans’ actuaries prepare both going \nconcern and solvency valuations for each plan. The most \nrecent actuarial valuation for the Academic FRB Plan was \nprepared as at December 31, 2021, while the Administrative/\nUnion Plan was prepared as at December 31, 2022.\nAnnual accounting valuations are prepared for the purposes \nof determining the present value of the accrued pension \nbenefit obligation and pension expense to be recorded in the \nfinancial statements. An extrapolation is performed from \nthe most recent actuarial valuation of each FRB plan, using \nassumptions determined by management in consultation with \nthe Plans’ actuaries and in accordance with PSAS. Accounting \nvaluations are prepared on a going concern basis that assumes \nthe plans will continue indefinitely . Assets are measured at \nmarket value, and liabilities measured using an appropriate \ndiscount rate. Accounting valuations were performed for both \nFRB plans as at December 31, 2023 using data from each of \ntheir most recent actuarial valuations.\nDefined benefit pension plan liability and expense\nThe liabilities of the FRB pension plans and current \nservice costs for the year have been based on accounting \nvaluations performed from the most recent actuarial \nvaluation of each plan.\nPension expense is allocated to the appropriate function, \nwithin the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while \nthe accrued pension asset is reported on the Consolidated \nStatement of Financial Position.\nPension plan for administrative/union staff (Administrative/\nUnion Plan)\nThe Administrative/Union Plan is a defined benefit FRB plan \nbased on a combination of years of service and the average \nof the plan member’s highest sixty consecutive months’ \nsalary .

The board \nof trustees for this plan, representing plan members and \nemployers, is responsible for administering the pension \nplan, including investing assets and administering benefits. \nThe plan is a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan. \nBasic pension benefits are based on a formula. As at August \n31, 2023, the College Pension Plan has about 17,200 active \nmembers, and approximately 10,700 retired members.\nEvery three years, an actuarial valuation is performed to \nassess the financial position of the plans and adequacy \nof plan funding. The actuary determines an appropriate \ncombined employer and member contribution rate to fund \nthe plans. The actuary’s calculated contribution rate is \nbased on the entry age normal cost method, which produces \nthe long-term rate of member and employer contributions \nsufficient to provide benefits for average future entrants to \nthe plans. This rate may be adjusted for the amortization of \nany actuarial funding surplus and will be adjusted for the \namortization of any unfunded actuarial liability.\nThe most recent actuarial valuation from the College Pension \nPlan as at August 31, 2021, indicated a $202,000,000 surplus \nfor basic pension benefits on a going concern basis.\nThe university paid $17,548,000 for employer contributions to \nthe plan in calendar year 2023 (2022: $17,126,000).\nThe next valuation for the College Pension Plan will be as at \nAugust 31, 2024, with results available in 2025.\nEmployers participating in the plan record their pension \nexpense as the amount of employer contributions made \nduring the fiscal year (defined contribution pension plan \naccounting). This is because the plans record accrued \nliabilities and accrued assets for each plan in aggregate, \nresulting in no consistent and reliable basis for allocating \nthe obligation, assets and cost to individual employers \nparticipating in the plan.\nAs a condition of joining the College Pension Plan, the \nuniversity and its employees who are members of the College \nPension Plan must contribute additional amounts equal \nto 1.68% of pensionable earnings until June 30, 2041. Both \nthe university and the members of the College Pension Plan \nare required to submit 0.84% of pensionable earnings to the \nCollege Pension Plan in addition to their regular employer \ncontributions and employee contributions respectively . \nPursuant to its collective agreement, SFUFA members \nreimburse the university for their share of SFU’s incremental \nemployer contributions through a cost sharing arrangement. \nNon-SFUFA members reimburse SFU directly for their \nshare of SFU’s incremental employer contributions directly \nthrough payroll deductions.",

Employee future benefits\nAccounting policy  \nThe university provides retirement and compensated absence benefits to employees.\nFor accounting purposes, the university measures the accrued benefit obligation, liability and expense of the fiscal period\nthrough actuarial and accounting valuations. Adjustments arising from changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial \ngains and losses are amortized over the Expected Average Remaining Service Lifetime (EARSL) of active employees, except \nfor long-term disability which, as an event driven compensated absence benefit, is recognized immediately .\nThe university does not segregate assets to specifically offset this liability. \nDescription of benefit plans  \nThe university operates three employee future benefit plans providing: non-pension retiree medical, extended health and dental \nbenefits; early retirement benefits; and provisions for long-term disability.\nActuarial Valuations are performed for both of the retirement benefit plans at least every three years, while the event driven \ncompensated absence benefit plan is performed annually . Such valuations determine the employer contribution rate necessary \nto provide adequate funding of the plan liabilities and are prepared using the projected benefit method, pro-rated on services. \nThe most recent actuarial valuation for the retirement plan was at December 31, 2021.\nAnnual accounting valuations have the primary purpose of determining the liability and expense to be recorded in the \nfinancial statements. Assumptions are determined congruent with relevant PSAS on a best estimate basis and are reviewed \non an annual basis. This valuation assumes the plan will continue indefinitely and extrapolates the present value of accrued \nliabilities and benefit expenses from the most recent actuarial valuations. Given the absence of plan assets, the discount rate \napplied is equal to the relevant cost of borrowing.\nRetirement benefits  \nRetirement benefits represent the liabilities of the university to provide non-pension retiree benefits and early retirement \nbenefits to the employees in return for their services. As employees render services, the value of the retirement benefits are \nattributed to those services and recorded as liabilities and expenses. Gains or losses resulting from accounting valuations are \namortized over EARSL using the straight line method, commencing the following fiscal year.\nNon-pension retiree benefits  \nNon-pension retiree benefits represent the liabilities for portions of future premiums payable on behalf of eligible current \nemployees and retirees for medical, extended health and dental benefits. Only employees hired before dates between July 1, \n2001 and May 1, 2003, depending on employee group, are eligible for this benefit. The most recent accounting valuation reported \nan actuarial loss of $674,000 (2023 actuarial gain: $8,973,000) to be amortized over EARSL.\nEarly retirement benefits  \nEarly retirement benefits represent the liabilities to employees who took early retirement in the mid 1990’s and other \nemployees who receive supplementary pensions. The most recent accounting valuation reported an actuarial loss of $127,000 \n(2023 actuarial gain: $802,000) to be amortized over EARSL.\nEvent driven liabilities  \nCompensated absence and long-term disability benefits represent liabilities that are created when events that obligate the \nuniversity occur. Actuarial valuations are performed each year for these event driven liabilities. The expected costs of providing \nthe benefits are recognized immediately in the period when such events occur. An insurance company administers the long-\nterm disability plans and is reimbursed for disability claim payments plus service fees.",

Net restricted endowment contributions  \nEndowment consists of restricted donations to the university. The investment income generated from endowments must be \nused in accordance with purposes established by donors. Donors, as well as university policy , stipulate that the economic value \nof the endowments must be protected by limiting the amount of income that may be expended and endowing a portion of \ninvestment income in order to maintain purchasing power.\n23. Contingent liabilities  \nFrom time to time, the university is involved in litigation or \nproceedings relating to claims arising out of its operations \nin the ordinary course of business. It is expected that the \nultimate outcome of these claims will not have a material \neffect on the financial position of the university. The majority \nof these claims are covered by the university’s insurance \ncoverage. Any university payouts that may result from these \nclaims will be recorded in the period when it becomes likely \nand determinable.\nThe university is a member in a self-insurance cooperative, \nin association with other Canadian universities, to provide \nproperty and general liability insurance coverage. Under \nthe Canadian Universities Reciprocal Insurance Exchange \n(CURIE), the university is required to share in any net losses \nexperienced by CURIE beyond the reserves that CURIE has \naccumulated from member premiums. Members of CURIE \nhave exposure to retroactive premium assessments should \nthe premiums be insufficient to cover losses and expenses. \nNo provision has been made for this potential liability. The \nuniversity is committed to this insurance arrangement until \nDecember 31, 2027.\nAt March 31, 2024 the university is liable for Letters of Credit \nin the amount of $360,000 (2023 $91,678,000). The 2024 \namount includes Letters of Credit related to development \narrangements while the 2023 amount is related to pensions \nand development arrangements.\n24. Liability for contaminated sites  \nAccounting policy  \nContaminated sites are a result of contamination of a chemical, organic or radioactive material or live organism that exceeds \nan environmental standard, being introduced into soil, water or sediment. The liability is recorded net of any expected \nrecoveries. A liability for remediation of contaminated sites is recognized when all the following criteria are met:\n(i) an environmental standard exists;\n(ii) contamination exceeds the environmental standard;\n(iii) the university is directly responsible or accepts responsibility; and\n(iv) a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.\nThe university recognized an estimated liability of \n$5,200,000 (2023: $4,600,000) for the remediation of two \ncontaminated sites: 1) resulting from salt leaking from a \nsalt shed into nearby groundwater and surface water and \n2) salt contamination of soil. The estimated total future \nexpenditures are $5,200,000. The balance is recorded in \naccounts payable and accrued liabilities.",

Now more than ever, \nwe need to focus on building a prosperous, low-carbon, sustainable economy, and a province where \neveryone can find a good home in rural areas, in cities and in Indigenous communities. \nThis mandate letter, which I am sending in my capacity as Minister responsible for post-secondary \ninstitutions, sets out overarching principles relevant to the entire public sector and specific direction \nGovernment and public sector organizations must continue to advance results that people can see \nand feel in these key areas: strengthened health care, safer communities, attainable and secure \nhousing and a clean and fair economy that delivers affordability and prosperity.\nIn doing so, you will continue working towards lasting and meaningful Reconciliation by supporting \nopportunities for Indigenous Peoples to be full partners in the province we are \nbuilding together and delivering on specific commitments as outlined in the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples Act action plan.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province. CAS \ncan support you in public sector governance best practices, policy and planning. \nI expect you to ensure the important priorities and areas of focus listed in this letter are incorporated \ninto the practices of your institution and develop plans to address the following new priorities within \nyour approved budget and within the following context. \nPost-secondary education and training are fundamental for anyone who wishes to access and \nsucceed in most careers in our province. We know that 80 per cent of the 1 million new job openings \nin BC over the next decade will require post-secondary education and training.

Achieving the objectives of the \nAction Plan will require collaboration across many sectors, driven by the post-secondary sector.",

    "content": "2\n2023 ONWARDS\nWHAT’S NEXT: THE SFU STRATEGY  \nMESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT \nSFU is a university that knows how to meet the moment. Since our founding, there has always been something special—\nsomething different—about us. In our early days, we were known as the “radical campus,” a university that wasn’t afraid to \ncause a little trouble and challenge the status quo. \nOver the past decade, we have come into our own as Canada’s engaged university, set apart by our commitment to creating \ndeep and impactful relationships with communities and people in B.C. and around the world. We defy expectations and lead \nthe competition; we harness our innovative spirit and strengths in teaching and research to help create solutions to the world’s \nmost pressing problems.\nAt every stage of our journey , from 1965 to present day , we have responded to the changing needs of both the world around us \nand the people and communities we serve. And now , it’s time for SFU to evolve again. We are living through a critical time in \nhistory . From a global pandemic and growing inequities to shifting geopolitics and the climate crisis, the challenges we face are \ncomplex and daunting. We’ve heard that our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and partners are ready and excited to tackle these \nissues and, as a public educational institution, we have a moral and civic obligation to do so. It’s time for us to take our next big \nstep as a university and meet this moment in a way that only SFU can.  \nSo, we launched a process to ask: what does the path forward look like, and how do we make the most of the opportunity in \nfront of us? Informed by all we heard from our communities, What’s Next: The SFU Strategy is our response. \nWe are a leading research university, advancing an inclusive and sustainable future. This is our vision: who we aspire to be.\nWe create and connect knowledge, learning, and community for deeper understanding and meaningful impact. This is our \npurpose: why we exist.\nWe’re going to bring our vision and purpose to life by progressing four priorities that mean the most to us as a community: \nupholding truth and Reconciliation, engaging in global challenges, making a difference for B.C., and transforming the SFU \nexperience. These priorities affirm and expand upon the three I established in the first year of my presidency . They represent \nour determination to do what we know is both right and needed, creating change not just in the world, but inside our \ninstitution as well. \nThis strategy makes explicit these shared areas of focus and it outlines the initiatives through which we will channel our \nindividual and collective efforts. In so doing, it creates the crucial framework for decision making, resource allocation, and \naccountability that we set out to create in this process.  \nI am so grateful to all those who contributed their perspectives and ideas through thousands of engagements over the last year. \nThis is our strategy , and it is a bold strategy . It will take all of us, working together, to bring it to life. But we have more than 50 \nyears of incredible history from which to build. And we’re ready . I know we are.\nNow we know what’s next for Canada’s engaged university, and I invite you to come along as we embark on this next stage of \nour journey . Let’s get started! \n \n \nJoy Johnson \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \nSimon Fraser University",

We have the responsibility to prepare students for \nthe unknown and the unknowable, and to provide opportunities for them to continue learning throughout their lives. We must \nembrace this agility in how we partner with those around us and how we work as an organization. \nAnd what we heard from our community during the planning conversations was remarkably consistent. Students, faculty, staff, \nalumni, and partners want us to amplify our focus on commitments that have long defined SFU while also making significant \nchanges throughout the university to enable this work. Many of these desires are a reflection of our stage in development as an \ninstitution; all reflect the current state of the world around us and the unique role we can play in making it a better place. \nTogether, members of SFU’s communities are asking us to:\n1. Centre the university’s academic mandate\n2. Embrace accountability for student learning, respecting the unique needs of SFU students\n3. Support faculty and staff in their work and sustain the collegiality that makes SFU special\n4. Continue to align expertise in community engagement with research and learning \n5. Promote and protect the mental health and well-being of students, faculty, and staff \n6. Advance social justice, inclusion, and climate action\n7. Extend SFU’s commitment to Reconciliation \n8. Help bring the world to B.C. and embed a global perspective in our people and our work\n9. Better connect disciplines, cultures, and campuses\n10. Address pressing operational problems, making SFU a better place to work \nThrough this strategy , we are responding to the input of the members of SFU’s communities. Our shared conviction that SFU can \nmake a difference is a potent starting point. We are enabled by our expertise, resources, and responsiveness. Mostly , though, it is \nthe people of SFU who equip us to succeed.",

We asked ourselves: what does Canada’s engaged university do next? This strategy highlights the powerful hopes \nand ideals we embody and reinforces the fundamental importance of knowledge, discovery , and community. It describes the \nSFU we know and the SFU we know we can be.\nVision: Who we aspire to be\nWE ARE A LEADING RESEARCH UNIVERSITY, ADVANCING AN INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\nBuilding from our progress as Canada’s engaged university, our vision represents our ambitions for the next stage in SFU’s \njourney , provincially , nationally , and internationally . The vision inspires and drives us, declaring both our goals as a global \nresearch community and our deeply felt and abiding commitments to belonging and climate action. Our challenge in this strategy \nis to consistently rise to the standards of the vision; our future and the future of the world depend on it.           \nPurpose: Why we exist\nWE CREATE AND CONNECT KNOWLEDGE, LEARNING, AND COMMUNITY FOR DEEPER UNDERSTANDING \nAND MEANINGFUL IMPACT\nOur purpose as a university is the essence of SFU; it is what each of us strives to do daily . It reflects our belief that we are a \ncommunity of citizens and scholars, working with partners to develop and share knowledge and make a difference in the world. \nValues: How we do it\nOur values guide us as individuals and as an institution. The alignment and, in some cases, apparent tensions between the values \nencourage us to think carefully about the choices we make. The articulation of engagement as a value sets SFU apart from our \npeers and reflects the integrity of our position as Canada’s engaged university. We will embed these values in every decision and \nevery action, and hold ourselves accountable for doing so. \nACADEMIC FREEDOM AND CRITICAL THINKING\nWe honour the autonomy of intellectual enquiry and explore \nideas with academic rigour.\nEXCELLENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY \nWe aspire to high standards and truth in information, \naccountable to one another and the public. \nRESPECT AND RECIPROCITY\nWe build and sustain relationships with care and a desire for \nmutual growth.\nEQUITY AND BELONGING \nWe create an inclusive, supportive, and affirming \ncommunity, where all thrive.\nENGAGEMENT AND OPENNESS\nWe seek and include diverse perspectives and a wide circle of \ninvolvement.\nRESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY \nWe steward resources effectively , with the needs of present \nand future generations in mind.\nINNOVATION AND ADAPTABILITY \nWe learn, unlearn, and embrace uncertainty through \ndiscovery and failure.\nThere are clear connections across our vision, purpose, and values; we cannot advance any one aspect without advancing the \nothers. How and why we do what we do are just as important—if not more so—than what we do. These interdependencies \nweave the strong fabric that supports this strategy and the university more broadly .",

We will uphold truth and Reconciliation, engage in global challenges, \nmake a difference for B.C., and transform the SFU experience. Each reflects deep commitment to progress, whether through our \nresearch and teaching, through our engagement with the world around us, or through how we work. The last is foundational for \nthe other three. \nEach priority builds from and extends activity already underway at the university. Each combines progress in teaching, research, \nand operations, so centring the academic mission. Together, they exemplify the balance that has always defined us, notably the \nconvergence of external and internal orientation in our work. They are the lens through which we will achieve our vision and \npurpose, motivating and coalescing the efforts of everyone at SFU. \nThe initiatives identified within the priorities are the basis for action and resource allocation. While the strategy is not time \nbound, the initiatives describe our work for the next five years, though most will continue well beyond that point. Many are \nreinforcing, with success in one contributing to success in others. Each year, we will establish projects that ensure progress. \nWhile the initiatives are indicative of future direction, they are not intended to prescribe or constrain. We will learn and adapt as \nwe move forward, consistent with the principles of continuous improvement.\nUPHOLD TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION\nSFU recognizes and honours the title and rights of Indigenous people as stated in UNDRIP and we respect and partner with the \nhost Indigenous Nations on which our campuses are located. We have the responsibility to illuminate the truth of Indigenous \npeople in Canada and around the world and to begin to chart a path of Reconciliation. We will embrace this critical and complex \ncall, striving to create a strong and safe sense of belonging for all Indigenous people to strengthen and harness their inherent gifts.\nThrough this strategy we will:\n• Improve the support, mentorship, and recruitment of Indigenous students, with continuing focus on curriculum innovation, \nwelcoming spaces, and learner pathways\n• Strengthen Indigenous faculty and staff attraction and retention through targeted hires and permanent positions, \nembedding Indigenous knowledge systems and ways of knowing\n• Harness momentum and insight for sustainable change within and beyond SFU, aligning our priorities and approach \nthrough a new Indigenous Strategic Plan \nENGAGE IN GLOBAL CHALLENGES\nWith leading researchers in today’s critical issues, from climate action to democracy to health outcomes, combined with our \nfocus on developing entrepreneurship and a global mindset in our students, we effect positive outcomes. Working with peers and \ncolleagues around the world, these efforts are underpinned by our shared commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals. \nWe will leverage our experience, approach, and connections to help address humanity’s most complex problems and questions.\nThrough this strategy , we will: \n• Cultivate a thriving research and teaching environment that deepens the undergraduate and graduate experience and \nprepares students for varied careers \n• Enable and value interdisciplinarity and diverse forms of scholarship, notably in community-centred climate innovation, \nto spark creativity and collaboration \n• Invest in world-class faculty and infrastructure, while connecting SFU scholars with national and international research \nnetworks",

For students, we are a global university in their communities, offering relevant, \nexceptional education. We attract learners from around the world and many of our alumni remain in B.C. after graduation, \ncontributing their talents and enriching society. Through our people, research, partnerships, and spaces, we make our mark, \nbolstered by our collective attention to community engagement. We will reinforce our role as the university for B.C., using our \ncapacity for social and economic change to strengthen the province and connect the world with B.C.\nThrough this strategy we will:\n• Expand experiential education, lifelong learning, and credential models to improve student outcomes and accelerate \nregional impact and innovation \n• Establish a socially accountable medical school and graduate physicians with the competencies to provide team-based \nhealth care and serve B.C.’s diverse communities \n• Facilitate evidence-informed public dialogue that fosters pluralism and shared problem-solving across the province\nTRANSFORM THE SFU EXPERIENCE\nTo achieve these priorities, we need to put students at the heart of all we do, create the conditions for faculty and staff to flourish, \nand actively embrace possibilities and new ways of doing things. We must focus on the well-being of all those who learn and \nwork at SFU, mindful of preparing students for an uncertain and complex world. We will break barriers, reduce biases, and create \nsystems that promote student success, improve campus vibrancy , and create space for everyone to do their best work.\nThrough this strategy we will:\n• Sustain the excellence of an SFU education, meeting the changing needs of learners through curriculum and service \nenhancements across our campuses that reflect the importance of mental health, affordability, and flexibility\n• Integrate progressive people practices that centre equity, encourage healthy working practices, and ensure a thriving SFU\n• Optimize processes, technology , and facilities to support people at SFU, propel the academic mandate, and reinforce \nresponsible stewardship \n4   ACCOUNTABILITY\nThe strategy will succeed through implementation. We will identify and track annual actions, responsibilities, and \nmilestones that map from the priorities and initiatives, mobilizing working groups and resources to assure meaningful \nprogress. We will align executive and governance processes with the strategy and manage strategic development through a \nscorecard of key performance indicators (KPIs).\nWhat’s Next: The SFU Strategy signals a shift in our planning ecosystem to converge upon a more streamlined and \ncoordinated set of plans, including the Academic and Strategic Research Plans, each of which explicitly supports and is \nsupported by the institutional strategy .\nSFU will need to remain agile as the next months and years unfold, and this strategy serves as a vital compass to guide \nthe university. It provides a powerful framework to help us make robust decisions, organize action, and hold ourselves \naccountable for progress. Perhaps most importantly , the strategy also articulates the story that we are proud to tell and \nfortunate to help shape as SFU continues its work of advancing inclusion and sustainability as a leading research university.",

Your leadership in advancing and protecting the public \ninterest strengthens trust in public institutions.\nYou are serving British Columbians at a time when people in our province continue to recover from \nand respond to the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, an ongoing toxic drug crisis, \nclimate-related natural disasters and while global inflation is driving up costs. Now more than ever, \nwe need to focus on building a prosperous, low-carbon, sustainable economy, and a province where \neveryone can find a good home in rural areas, in cities and in Indigenous communities. \nThis mandate letter, which I am sending in my capacity as Minister responsible for post-secondary \ninstitutions, sets out overarching principles relevant to the entire public sector and specific direction \nGovernment and public sector organizations must continue to advance results that people can see \nand feel in these key areas: strengthened health care, safer communities, attainable and secure \nhousing and a clean and fair economy that delivers affordability and prosperity.\nIn doing so, you will continue working towards lasting and meaningful Reconciliation by supporting \nopportunities for Indigenous Peoples to be full partners in the province we are \nbuilding together and delivering on specific commitments as outlined in the Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples Act action plan.",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province. CAS \ncan support you in public sector governance best practices, policy and planning. \nI expect you to ensure the important priorities and areas of focus listed in this letter are incorporated \ninto the practices of your institution and develop plans to address the following new priorities within \nyour approved budget and within the following context. \nPost-secondary education and training are fundamental for anyone who wishes to access and \nsucceed in most careers in our province. We know that 80 per cent of the 1 million new job openings \nin BC over the next decade will require post-secondary education and training. The StrongerBC \nFuture Ready Action Plan aims to make education and training more accessible, affordable and \nrelevant to prepare British Columbians for the jobs of tomorrow. Achieving the objectives of the \nAction Plan will require collaboration across many sectors, driven by the post-secondary sector.",

The pursuit of knowledge \ntranscends borders, cultures and geographies, making it inherently \ninternational. Internationalization plays a critical role in this process. It refers \nto integrating global dimensions into the curriculum, research and university \nculture, ensuring that students and members of the Thompson Rivers \nUniversity community engage with diverse ideas and contexts. 1,2 International, \nintercultural and global dimensions are used intentionally as a triad of terms to \nreflect the breadth of internationalization. 3\nIn this pursuit of internationalization and TRU’s vision of Kw’seltktnéws  \n(we are all related and interconnected with nature, each other, and all things), \nTRU recognizes the need to approach this commitment with a foundation \nrooted in reconciliation and decolonization. 4 This requires us to align our \nactions with the values and principles of the Secwépemc Nation, upon whose \ntraditional lands TRU stands. As we integrate global perspectives into our \ncurriculum, research, and campus culture, we must also ensure that these \nefforts honour and reflect the knowledge, wisdom and stewardship of the \nIndigenous people who have cared for these lands for generations. Only by \ndoing so can we truly embody a respectful, inclusive and forward-looking \napproach to internationalization.\nDRAFT",

This is why we place \nsuch importance on Institutional Learning Outcomes (ILOs). 5 Through ILOs, \nwe ensure that our educational environment fosters a comprehensive \nunderstanding of international contexts, equipping students to thrive in a world \nwhere knowledge knows no borders.\nBuilding on our 40-year history of leadership in international education, we have \ndeveloped a comprehensive internationalization plan to build on this legacy. \nThis plan is designed to deepen and expand our commitment to welcoming \nand fostering global perspectives across all aspects of the university. By \ncontinuing to embed internationalization into our curriculum, research and \ncampus culture, we aim to create an environment where every student can \nengage meaningfully with global issues and diverse perspectives. This plan will \nensure that we continue to lead in preparing students for the opportunities and \nchallenges of an increasingly interconnected world. \nThe Strategic Internationalization Plan (SIP) outlines the vision, goals and \nobjectives for TRU’s future in internationalization. From a strategic planning \nperspective, the vision serves as the overarching guide, charting the \norganization’s direction, while the strategy outlines the specific steps and \nactions required to achieve that vision for internationalization at TRU.   \nThese steps will be outlined in annual SIP implementation plans, ensuring that \nstrategic initiatives are effectively executed, measured, resourced and aligned \nwith TRU’s evolving goals.6 Both the vision and the implementation plans are \nimportant: the vision provides a steady framework amid uncertainty, while \nthe implementation plans provide actionable strategies that can be reviewed \nannually to ensure effective execution aligned with TRU’s evolving goals  \nand needs.\nDRAFT",

We aspire to develop and share our innovative solutions to inspire progress and drive meaningful \nchange. In addition to being guided by the TRU Vision Statement, the Strategic Internationalization Plan is \nguided by the following principles:\nSituated in the heart of Secwépemc’ulucw, TRU \nis guided by the wisdom of knowledge keepers \nand Elders. We are committed to expanding \naccess for and support to students while actively \nworking to dismantle the systemic inequities \nrooted in our colonial past and present.\nWe are dedicated to making decisions that \nhonour the rights and opportunities of current \nand future generations, ensuring sustainable \nsolutions that balance the needs of today’s \ncommunities with those of tomorrow.\nWe turn our commitments into actions by \nensuring that policies, strategic plans and \nprograms align across the institution and that \nresources are allocated equitably and effectively.\nWe are driven by a curiosity to go beyond \ntraditional approaches to internationalization, \nleveraging our unique position as the only \nteaching and research-focused university in \nBC that integrates a trades and technology \nschool, an open learning mandate, and diverse \neducational modalities. Our expertise enables \nus to reach and engage diverse learners across \nCanada and around the world.\nDRAFT",

The group \nwas required to adopt this accounting policy as prescribed by Province of British Columbia \nTreasury Board Regulation 198/2011. \nUnder Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards, the group’s method of accounting for \ncontributions is only appropriate in circumstances where the funding meets the definition of a \nliability. Otherwise, the appropriate accounting treatment is to record contributions as revenue \nwhen they are received or receivable. In my opinion, certain contributions of the entity do not \nmeet the definition of a liability, and as such the group’s method of accounting for those \ncontributions represents a departure from Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards. \nThis departure has existed since the inception of the standard, which applies to periods \nbeginning on or after April 1, 2012. Had the group made an adjustment for this departure in the \ncurrent year, the liability for deferred capital contributions as at March 31, 2024 would have \nbeen lower by $1,832 million, revenue, annual surplus and accumulated surplus would have \nbeen higher by $1,832 million and net debt would have been lower by $1,832 million.",

My \nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for \nthe Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of \nthe group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the \ngroup’s financial statements in Canada, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in \naccordance with these requirements. \nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the \nConsolidated Financial Statements \nThose charged with governance are responsible for the oversight of the financial reporting \nprocess. Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the \nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting \nStandards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the \npreparation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \nwhether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing \nthe group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to \ngoing concern and using the going concern basis of accounting when the group will continue its \noperations for the foreseeable future. \nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the group’s consolidated \nfinancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or \nerror, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high \nlevel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian \ngenerally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decision of users \ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, I \nexercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I \nalso: \n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to fraud or error; design and perform audit procedures\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to\nprovide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement\nresulting from fraud is higher than one resulting from error, as fraud may involve\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal\ncontrol.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.",

    "content": "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nYEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 \nPage | 10 \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \n1  Authority and Purpose \nThe University of British Columbia ( “UBC” or “the University”) operates under the authority of the University Act \nof British Columbia. UBC is a comprehensive research university offering a full range of undergraduate, graduate, \nand continuing studies programs. The academic governance of the University is vested in the Senate. As a not -\nfor-profit entity, UBC is governed by a Board of Governors, the majority of whom are appointed by the provincial \ngovernment of British Columbia. UBC is also a registered charity and is therefore exempt from income taxes \nunder Section 149 of the Income Tax Act. \n2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nThese consolidated financial statements of the University are prepared by management in accordance with the \nbasis of accounting described below. The significant accounting policies of UBC are as follows:  \n(a) Basis of Accounting\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23.1 of the Budget\nTransparency and Accountability Act  of the Province of British Columbia supplemented by Regulations\n257/2010 and 198/2011 issued by the Province of British Columbia Treasury Board, referred to as the\nFinancial Reporting Framework (“FRF”).\nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act  requires that the consolidated financial statements be\nprepared in accordance with Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standards (“PSAS”) except as modified by\nregulation 198/2011. This regulation requires that restricted contributions for acquiring or developing a\ndepreciable tangible capital asset or contributions in the form of a depreciable tangible capital asset be\naccounted for as deferred capital contributions as described in note 2(d)(i).\nRevenue recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus and certain\nrelated deferred capital contributions are recorded differently under FRF than under PSAS. Note 2 7\nsummarizes the impact of FRF versus PSAS on the consolidated financial statements.\n(b) Basis of Consolidation\n(i) Consolidated Entities\nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of\norganizations that are controlled by UBC, as well as its proportional interest in government partnerships.\nGovernment business enterprises are accounted for using the modified equity method.\nThe following organizations , which  are 100% controlled by the University , are consolidated in these\nfinancial statements. Inter-organizational transactions, balances, and activities have been eliminated on\nconsolidation.\n• UBC Investment Management Trust Inc.  is an investment manager that manages the University’s\nmain endowment fund, working capital fund and the Staff Pension Plan.\n• UBC Foundation  was established under the University Foundations Act to encourage financial\nsupport for the University.\n• American Foundation for UBC is a registered public charity that was created to develop public\nawareness and encourage financial support for the University in the United States.",

Under this\nmethod, the University’s investment in the business enterprise , as well as  its net income and other\nchanges in equity, are recorded as earned. No adjustment is made to conform the accounting policies of\nthe government business enterprise to those of UBC other than if other comprehensive income exists,\nwhich is accounted for as an adjustment to the accumulated surplus (deficit) of the University. Inter -\norganizational transactions and balances have not been eliminated, except for any profit or loss on\ntransactions between entities of assets remaining within the entities controlled by UBC.\nThe following organizations are government business enterprises and are accou nted for using the\nmodified equity method\n• UBC Properties Investments Ltd. (“UBCPIL”) (100% interest)\n• Great Northern Way Campus Trust (“GNWCT”) (25% interest)\n(iii) Investment in Government Partnerships\nGovernment partnerships are accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method. The\nconsolidated financial statements include the University’s 20% interest in Western Canadian Universities\nMarine Sciences Society, which operates as Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre.\n(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a term to maturity of three months or less\nat the date of purchase.",

Amounts received in advance of the provision of services or goods are recorded as\ndeferred revenue.\n(iii) Land Lease Revenue\nThe University enters into prepaid lease agreements for residential and commercial properties for a\nperiod of 99 years. The prepaid amount is initially recognized as deferred land lease revenue when the\nlease contract has been entered into and then recognized as revenue over the 99-year lease term.",

Sales and purchases of investments are r ecorded on the trade date.

The different levels are defined as follows:\n• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or\nliability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)\n• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable\ninputs)",

Fixed income investments held for specific purposes  are recorded at amortized cost.\nOther financial instruments including account s receivable, promissory notes receivable, housing and\nother loans receivable, and accounts payables , are recorded at amortized cost.  Debt is measured at\namortized cost adjusted for discounts, premiums, and issue costs using the effective interest rate method.\nGains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus\nupon derecognition or impairment.\n(f) Inventories for Resale\nInventories held for resale are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using\nthe weighted average basis. It includes invoice cost and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to\ntheir present location and condition. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated\ncosts necessary to make the sale. Inventories are written down to net realizable value when the cost of\ninventories is estimated not to be recoverable.\n(g) Non-financial Assets\nNon-financial assets are unavailable to discharge existing liabilities and are held for use in the provision of\nservices. They have useful lives extending beyond the current year and are not intended for sale in the\nordinary course of operations.\n(i) Tangible Capital Assets\nTangible capital assets are recorded at cost, which includes amounts directly  attributable to  the\nacquisition, construction, development or betterment of the asset. Contributed tangible capital assets are\nrecorded at fair value at the date of contribution.\nTangible capital assets are amortized on a straight -line basis over their estimated useful life  as shown\nbelow. Land is not amortized as it is deemed to have a permanent value.\nSite improvements 15-80 years\nBuildings and renovations 5-50 years\nFurnishings, equipment and systems 3-10 years\nLibrary books 10 years\nAssets under construction are not amortized until the asset are available for productive use. \nTangible capital assets are written down when conditions indicate that they no longer contribute to UBC’s \nability to provide goods and services, or when the valu e of future economic benefits associated with the \ntangible capital assets is less than their net book value.",

These costs include the removal of hazardous materials such as\nasbestos and the decommissioning of facilities and equipment.\nAsset retirement obligations are initially measured on the estimated future cash flows required to settle the\nliability and discounted using the University’s cost of borrowing.   Subsequent to initial measurement, asset\nretirement obligations are adjusted to reflect the pa ssage of time and changes in the estimated future cash\nflows. The increase in the obligation due to the passage of time is recognized as accretion expense in the\nStatement of Operations.\nThe increases and decreases due to changes to the estimated future cash flows are recognized to the\ncarrying value of the underlying asset and amortized over the asset’s remaining useful life.  For those changes\nassociated with fully amortized tangible cap ital assets (and unrecognized tangible capital assets), these are\nrecorded to expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations  and Accumulated Surplus . Actual costs\nincurred upon settlement are charged against the obligation.\n(k) Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with PSAS requires management\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant areas requiring the use of management\nestimates and assumptions relate to the determination of useful lives of tangible c apital assets for\namortization and the amortization of related deferred capital contributions, valuation of financial instruments,\nthe present value of employee future benefits, provisions for contingencies, and future cash flows associated\nwith asset reti rement obligations . When actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions, the\nimpact will be recorded in future periods when the difference becomes known.\n(l) Functional Classification of Expenses\nExpenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Accumulated Surplus have been classified based\non functional lines of service provided by the University. The outline of services provided by each function is\nas follows:\n(i) Learning - This function includes expenses related to all direct educational delivery within the institution\nand activities that directly support the academic functions of the institution. This includes credit and non-\ncredit courses, diploma, certificate and degree programs, continuing education, curriculum and program\ndevelopment, libraries and galleries , online delivery and information technology. Costs associated with\nthis function include contract expenses , Deans/Directors and/or Chairs , instructional administration\n(general and financial), support staff, and support costs directly related to these activities.\n(ii) Research - This function includes research activities specifically funded by contracts and/or grants from\nexternal organizations and undertaken within the institution to produce research outcomes. Costs\nassociated with this function include research administration, research accounting, support costs\nestablished to conduct all research projects, and research-related amortization.\n(iii) Facilities - This function includes all capital asset related expenditures for the operation of the University.\nThese include the operation and maintenance of physical plant and equipment for all institutional\nactivities, utilities, facilities administration , custodial services; landscaping and groundskeeping , major\nrepairs and renovations , security services , administration of infrastructure development , amortization\nexpense (other than research related), and debt servicing costs related to the entire University.",

Performance obligations are enforceable\npromises to provide specific goods or services to a specific payer for consideration.  Revenue from\ntransactions with performance obligations is recognized when the University satisfies the performance\nobligations.\nThe application of the standard resulted in a decrease to University’s prior year sales and services and tuition\nand student fees revenues by $5.4 million, with a corresponding decrease to Learning expenses.

The University recognizes\nits contributions as expenses when the related service is provided.\nStaff Pension Plan\nThe Staff Pension Plan is a target benefit plan that provides benefits based on 1.8% (March 31, 2023 - 1.8%)\nof the average best three years’ basic salary multiplied by the number of years of contributory service. The\nUniversity’s contribution for the Staff Pension Plan is 9.4% of salary (March 31, 2023 - 9.4%). In the event of\nfunding deficiencies, the Un iversity’s contributions remain fixed and bene fits for members may be reduced.\nThe University accounts for this as a defined contribution plan and expenses its contributions when the related\nservice is provided . Benefits security for employees is improved by the plan maintaining a contingency\nreserve. The contingency reserve ceiling recommended by the plan’s actuary  and approved by the pension\nboard and Canada Revenue Agency is 40% of liabilities.",

The WCF is invested in pooled institutional fixed income and mortgage \nfunds, and the Province of B.C.’s Pr ovincial Central Deposit Program. Foreign currency risk is managed by \nlimiting foreign currency exposure to 10% of the investment portfolio.  \nMain Endowment Pool (MEP) \nThe MEP holds 95% of the carrying value of the endowment funds and is governed by a statement of investment \npolicy (SIP) approved by the University’s Board of Governors. The SIP defines the investment governance \nstructure, return objective and tolerance for in vestment risk. The objective of the MEP is to earn investment \nreturns to support a long -term sustainable spend rate and maintain the inflation -adjusted value of the capital to \npreserve intergenerational equity within the stated risk tolerance level.  \nThe UBC Board of Governors has approved a reference portfolio for the MEP that represents the University’s risk \ntolerance and serves as a benchmark to measure the investment risk in the actual investment portfolio. Market \nrisk is managed by setting parameters and constraints for the weighting of various investment asset classes and \nwith careful evaluation and due diligence in the selection of investment managers. The University reviews the \ninvestment portfolio returns, asset mix weightings and the forward -looking volatility of the investment portfolio \ncompared to the reference portfolio on a quarterly basis to ensure it is in alignment with the University’s selected \nrisk tolerance. The University also considers Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors as potential \ninvestment risks in the MEP and integrates monitoring of ESG risks into its assessment and monitoring of \ninvestment managers as well as climate risk analysis into the evaluation of the MEP’s future returns.  \nThe remaining endowment assets are held in investment funds as per the agreements with the respective donors. \nCredit Risk \nCredit risk is the risk a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The University \nis exposed to credit risk through its accounts receivable balances, which includes receivables from the Province \nof British Columbia and the federal government of Canada, tuition receivables, the distribution receivable from \nUBCPIL, and promissory notes receivable from UBCPIL and GNWCT . The remaining receivables from other \nsources are limited.  \nCredit risk from receivables from senior governments is low. Credit risk from tuition receivables is managed by \nrestricting enrollment activities for students with delinquent balances and through coll ection management. The \nUniversity manages credit risk to the distribution receivable and promissory notes receivable from UBCPIL by \nmonitoring its real estate development activities and has representation on the Board of Directors of UBCPIL.  \nThe Universit y manages credit risk to the promissory note receivable from GNWCT by monitoring activities \nthrough its representation on GNWCT’s Board of Directors and Advisory Committees . Counterparties to \nderivative instruments must have a long-term credit rating of A or higher.  \nForeign Exchange Risk \nThe functional currency of the University is the Canadian dollar. The University conducts some transactions in \nforeign currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar \nForeign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments or future cash flows associated with \nthose instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The University is exposed to foreign \nexchange risk on financial instrumen ts denominated in foreign currencies, including foreign currency bank \naccounts and currency forward contracts. The foreign exchange risk of these instruments has an insignificant \nimpact on the University’s results of operations.",

The University maintains a short -term liquidity target of 45 days of operating expenses, \nand an intermediate liquidity target of 90 days of operating expenses. In addition, the University maintains a \nseasonal line of credit ranging from $40 to $60 million and a $5 million USD current account overdraft  facility.  \nThe University prepares an annual operating budget to ensure that the University does not allocate any funding \nbeyond its expected earnings.

In recent years, the work of the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission of Canada and the publication \nof its Final Report and Calls to Action, and the development \nof the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \nPeoples, have brought attention to the ways in which \nCanadian educational and other institutions have failed \nand oppressed Indigenous people. At this historic juncture, \nUBC renews its commitments, articulated in the 2009 \nAboriginal Strategic Plan, to addressing this history and \ncharting a way forward that provides a basis for productive \nco-existence and a more equitable future. Specific \nmeasures are identified throughout this plan, and these  \nare being reviewed and revised in the context of the  \n2018 Indigenous Strategic Plan . \nShaping UBC’s Next Century builds on the successes of the \npast. The university recently celebrated its centennial, \nmarking 100 years of excellence in research, education and \nservice in British Columbia and beyond. UBC’s previous \nstrategic plan sparked significant academic achievements, \nwith deepening commitments to Indigenous people and \ncommunities, sustainability and alumni engagement. It \nchannelled institutional attention and activity toward \ninternational collaboration, intercultural understanding \nand outstanding work environments. Collectively, these \naccomplishments position us well to embrace the \nopportunities and navigate the challenges that lie ahead. \nThe locations of our campuses and multiple learning and \nresearch sites at the western edge of Canada enable fresh \nperspectives in a fast-changing global landscape. These \nare reinforced by the relative youth of UBC in the world of \nhigher education. \nAs a public institution, we are proud to play a pivotal role \nin British Columbia, shaping and participating in the \ndevelopment of its people, society and economic growth. \nAt the same time, UBC is a globally renowned university, \ncontributing world-leading research, providing distinctive \nexcellence in education, attracting outstanding people",

As a public institution, UBC \nhas the responsibility to ensure inclusion across students, \nfaculty, staff and alumni, and through all interactions \nbeyond the university. Inclusion is a commitment to \naccess, success and representation of historically \nunderserved, marginalized or excluded populations. Given \nthe long-lasting legacy of colonization of Indigenous \npeoples, we will continue to prioritize our partnerships \nwith Indigenous peoples and communities. Education is an \nenabler of social development and mobility, and UBC is \nintent on advancing the inclusion of all those who have \nbeen excluded historically based on gender, race, religion, \nsexuality, age, physical ability or economic circumstance. \nThe Equity and Inclusion Office at UBC provides leadership \nand co-ordination to further UBC’s commitment to \nInclusive Excellence—the embedding of support for equity \nand diversity in the systems and operations of the \nuniversity. The office offers data collection and analysis,  \nas well as case and issues management, working closely \nwith students, faculty and staff to ensure they have  \nthe tools and skills necessary to contribute to socially \nsustainable communities. Inclusion is also a focus in \nresearch and teaching. For example, faculty members in \nthe Stigma and Resilience Among Vulnerable Youth Centre \nin the School of Nursing have used mixed-methods \nresearch for close to 15 years with groups of vulnerable \nyouth—such as those experiencing homelessness and \ncharacterized by sexual diversity—to examine stigma, \nviolence and trauma, as well as factors that foster \nresilience. Research conducted in the Department of \nGeography is examining the relationship between \nCanadian immigration law and the integration of \nimmigrants in our cities, including the gendered and \ngenerational experiences of belonging for Syrian refugees \nresettling in Canada.\nOur investment in student financial assistance has a  \nstrong focus on needs-based bursary support and funding \nfor historically excluded student populations. Late in  \n2017, we launched the largest fundraising campaign for \nstudents in Canadian history. The Blue & Gold Campaign \nfor Students aims to raise $100 million in student support  \nover three years. Resources are also in place to support \ninternational students and commuter students, both \nintegral and vibrant parts of the university community.  \nTheme one: Inclusion",

From climate change, to emerging \npublic-health issues like the opioid crisis, to our strained \nsocial cohesion, progress will require new ways of working \nwithin and across disciplines and with the community. \nThese challenges demand a new approach to research,  \nin which interdisciplinary researchers or multidisciplinary \nteams come together to supplement the work in the \ndisciplines and to advance discovery, scholarship and \nknowledge exchange. Collaboration also has ramifications \nin teaching and learning, in curriculum and course design, \nand in providing students with the latitude to navigate  \ntheir interests and aptitudes. \nWith our two campuses and many learning and research \nsites—and through the strength of our connections across \nthe province and beyond—UBC is well positioned to \ncultivate collaborative efforts.

Technology and data are \nreshaping our world and how we interact with one another; \nthis explosion of information is opening new opportunities \nfor study, problem-solving and knowledge exchange \nbeyond the academy. For instructors and learners, there \nare gains to be had in supplementing the traditional \nclassroom experience and opening access to education \nthrough online learning. Universities must support \nstudents, faculty and staff in acquiring the skills and \ncompetencies necessary for achieving success in this \nrapidly changing landscape. Beyond its role in the evolution \nof research and education, this spirit of innovation must \nalso characterize how public universities operate and \nsteward resources.

Our partners include the health authorities \nthat provide clinical placements for our 4,000 health \nstudents across the province. And they include the \ndisciplinary societies, community and professional \nassociations, and unions that provide the framework for \nmuch of our activity. The university simply could not \nfunction without these constituents, many of whom \nconnect with UBC in different capacities, and all of whom \ncontribute perspective, knowledge and energy. Together, \nthey make UBC a diverse place in which we thrive as \nindividuals, peers and citizens. \nThe ‘places’ of UBC are equally varied. They encompass \nour campuses and campus communities at Point Grey and \nKelowna; locations in downtown Vancouver such as \nRobson Square; the hospitals at which our health students \nand faculty members conduct much of their work and the \nadditional sites of our distributed medical program; the \nLearning Exchange in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside; and \nnumerous sites of community-based research and learning \nthroughout British Columbia, across Canada and beyond. \nOur virtual places are expanding rapidly to include online \nclass discussions, internet-hosted open educational \nresources created by UBC faculty, and conference links \nthat connect our various sites in collaborative research  \nand learning. \ncore area one: people and places",

A rapidly diversifying economy, \nsocial context and job market demand a different kind  \nof education: one with a greater focus on competencies \nand transferable skills, such as critical thinking, \ncollaboration and communication, and one that promotes \nand supports continuous learning. To keep pace with the \ninformation age, and to meet the increasing expectations \nof students and employers, universities are investing \nsystemically in active, experiential and online models of \ncore area three: Transformative Learning",

    "content": "57 UBC’ s strategic plan 2018\nLike most universities, UBC has traditionally organized  \nits curriculum around a structure of credit hours  \ndelineated by courses. The Faculties of Medicine and  \nArts have adopted more flexible program structures \norganized around learning outcomes, which allows \nstudents to progress through a finer-grained set of  \nlearning experiences that build competencies. UBC will \nmove further towards using learning outcomes as a \nprimary organizing principle of program structure and \ncompletion. This approach will better engage student \ncuriosity and initiative: it allows for a more individualized \napproach, supporting learning with clearer feedback to \nhelp students focus on competencies they have yet to \nmaster. Our plans here must be made with care, as many \ndisciplines face highly structured accreditation \nrequirements and course structures, including necessary \nprerequisites. Efforts to redesign programs will need to \nrespect these and will involve strong collaborations \nbetween faculty and students, and, in many cases, alumni. \nThe process will be treated as an opportunity to build  \na better understanding of student learning and how it can \nbe supported most effectively. \nWe will work with external partners and alumni to  \nincrease experiential learning—‘learning by doing’—across \nacademic programs, and to enhance career services. \nWhere these connections extend beyond the province, \nthey will create scope for UBC to broaden its perspective \nand capacity for influence. Through initiatives such  \nas the Work Learn Program at UBC Vancouver, we will \nstrengthen opportunities for students to develop \nprofessional and research skills while studying. All these \nefforts will improve the ability of our graduates to secure \nmeaningful employment. Through UBC Extended Learning \n(ExL), we will support faculty in expanding online and  \nother accessible offerings in response to evolving demand \nfrom working practitioners and lifelong learners, many  \nof whom are UBC alumni. Scholarly communication is a \nskill consistently ranked at the top of those required \nbeyond the degree. In collaboration with all faculties at \nUBC Vancouver, the Faculty of Arts will create a unit to \nhouse academic and professional communications \ncurricula and related services. Our ability to make progress \non this strategy is predicated on strong industry and \ncommunity relationships; we will work hard to deepen and \nbetter co-ordinate these connections.

These statements are the consolidation of \nall university operations, including the results of general operations, ancillary operations, capital projects, \nendowment returns and spending, research grants and expenditures , etc. As required by Public Sector \nAccounting Standards, they also include the financial results of each of the university’s 12 external entities \nas well as the staff pension plan.  While these entities are required to be included in the financial \nstatements, their assets are restricted for specific purposes (e.g., pension) and therefore are not available \nto support general operations of the university. \nThe objective of this Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) document is to assist readers of the \nuniversity’s financial statements to better understand the financial position and operating activities of the \nuniversity for fiscal year March 31, 2024, as presented in accordance with the above reporting framework. \nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements and \naccompanying notes. \nThe operations of the University have been guided by our teaching and research priorities and institutional \nplans such as Aspiration 2030: Research and Creative Works Plan, Equity Action Plan, Campus Plan and \nthe Climate and Sustainability Action Plan. In 2023 the University launched Distinctly UVic: A Strategy for \nthe University of Victoria and  a new Indigenous plan —Xʷkʷənəŋ istəl W̱ ȻENEṈISTEL: Helping to move \neach other forward. These plans underpin our approach and priorities as a community and a university \nand that will guide our decision making in the coming years  \nThe university annually develops a Planning and Budget Framework  (P&BF), which is informed by these \ninstitutional plans. The P&BF and associated financial models are developed within the context of a three-\nyear planning cycle  which provides a more realistic time frame  for the development of university \ninitiatives and allows for greater flexibility than permitted within an annual process.  \nThe MD&A provides an overview of the university’s \n• financial highlights, \n• financial information, \n• operating environment,  \n• financial reporting environment, \n• risks and uncertainties, and \n• related entities. \nAlong with many other post-secondary institutions in BC and Canada, national and global factors \ncontinue to create pressure and uncertainty with our enrolment and budget outlook.

Overall expenses increased year over year mostly due to \nsalaries and associated benefits  collectively bargained under the shared recovery mandate but also \nreflecting a return to more normal activity levels for certain expenses such as travel, supplies, utilities and \ncost of goods sold. Overall, the University ended the year with a modest  positive operating result which \nis slightly lower than the prior year. Through another challenging financial year, we are grateful for work \nundertaken by our campus leaders to respond to the enrolment challenge and to the dedication, creativity \nand resilience of our faculty, staff and students.",

This increase reflects a $74.3M (23%) \nincrease in government grants due to  provincial \nfunding related to salary increases, as well as \nincreased federal funding for research. \nInvestment income decreased by $19.8M (33%) \nas 2022/23  included $ 34.7M of  investment \nincome from the settlement of an interest rate \nswap derivative on debt related to the student \nhousing and dining (SHD) project.  This decrease \nwas offset by increase s in investment income \nrelated to endowments and the university’s \nworking capital.  Sales, mainly within ancillary \noperations, increased by $6.7M (10%).   \nConsolidated Expenses in creased by $63.0M \n(9%) to $754M reflecting increased salaries and \nbenefits, supplies and services, travel  and \nscholarships, fellowships and bursaries expense. \nConsolidated assets total $2.0 billion, an increase \nof $125M (7%) from prior year, mainly as a result \nof $60.9M (6%) growth in tangible capital assets \nresulting from investments in new buildings and \ninfrastructure renewal, a $28.3M (19%) increase \nin cash and cash equivalents and a $22.7M (11%) \nincrease in portfolio investments due to strong \nfinancial markets.  \nDebt decreased by $ 5.4M as a result of regular \ndebt repayments and  a $3.8M bond which was \nrepaid in December 2023. During the year, $18M \nof short -term commercial paper loans were \nconverted to a 30-year bond.   \nEach year the u niversity is required to invest in \ncapital expenditures  to meet program \nrequirements and/or address deferred \nmaintenance. While these expenditures are \nmade each year, for accounting purposes the \nexpenditures are not shown as an expense in the \nyear made. Instead, the expenditure is \nexpensed, or amortized, over the future life of \nthe asset.  The University  received approval to \nrestrict $ 15M of provincial grants for capital \nexpenditures to provide for better matching of \nrevenues and amortization. This restriction only \nreflects a portion of total capital spending and \ntherefore the year’s operating surplus is higher \nas capital expenditures are not  reflected in the \noperating surplus.  \nGovernment Grants  \nRevenue from the Government in the form of \ngrants increased by  74.3M ( 23%) over the \nprevious year. Annual grants received from the \nProvince for capital purposes including routine \ncapital and specific project funding were \n$20.8M.  \n  \nTuition and Enrolment \nOverall, credit tuition decreased by 3.8M (2%) to \n$160.4M. This reflects a decrease in \nundergraduate international enrolment, offset \nby a 2% increase in domestic fees (Provincial \nGovernment policy lim its annual domestic \nincreases to 2%) and graduate international fees, \nand a 6 .75% increase in undergraduate \ninternational fees . Non-credit tuition increased \nby $1.9M (8%) due to increased enrolment.  \n \n.",

The university’s endowment \ninvestments are held in the University of Victoria \nFoundation and have a fair value of $ 555M. The \nendowments had a return of 13.4% for the year \n(2022/23 – return of 3.8 %) across its eight \ninvestment mandates. Working capital \ninvestments held within the u niversity \ngenerated a return of 5.4%% for the year  \n(2022/23 – return of 2.2%). \n \nMajor Capital Activity \nThe second  student housing building, Sngequ \nHouse, opened in summer 2023 to complete a \n620 bed expansion as part of a student housing \nand dining project. The first building, Cheko’nien \nHouse, opened  in fall 2022.

Due from governments \ndecreased by $ 12.2M, reflecting timing \ndifferences and year end funding.  Portfolio \ninvestments, which include the u niversity’s \nworking capital, investments underlying \nendowment expendable funds, investments \nrelated to sinking funds held for provincial debt, \nand supplemental pension obligations, increased \nby $ 22.7M due largely  to strong per formance \nwithin the UVic Foundation’s endowment \ninvestments and the university’s working capital. \nIn 202 0/21, the u niversity entered into two \ninterest rate swaps for the debt related to the \nSHD project in order to reduce the risk of higher \ninterest rates and subsequent  higher debt \npayments. Interest rates have risen across 5-, 10- \nand 30 -year terms and the swaps have \nperformed as expected.  During 202 3/24, the \nUniversity settled the last interest rate swap \nderivative which resulted in a $5.8M gain.    \nEmployee future benefits represent a future \nasset for the Staff Pension Plan and liabilities for \nsupplemental pension obligations, vested sick \nleave entitlements, and group life insurance \nplans. Investments in government business \nenterprises represent the equity held in \ncontrolled business operations of Heritage \nRealty Properties  Ltd, the Vancouver Island \nTechnology Park (VITP) Trust, and GSB Executive \nEducation Inc.",

Our \ndomestic enrolment has recovered following a \ndecline in 2022/23 and is at its highest level to \ndate. This is a result of strategic investments in \nentrance scholarships, earlier admission offers, \nand significant efforts within the faculties and in \nthe Division of Student Affairs. Graduate \nenrolment is also tracking well, ahead of \nprevious years, thanks in part to our research \nreputation and the quality of our faculty and \ngraduate programs. Domestic applications \nremain strong for 2024/25, and we continue to \nprioritize investments in scholarships to attract \nand support a diverse and talented student \npopulation. \n \nWhile the approach shown above provides for \ndomestic undergraduate enrolment growth, the \ndecrease in undergraduate international tuition \nmore than offsets domestic growth and the total \nenrolment projections are significantly less than \nbudgeted in 2023/24.  Although tuition revenue \nis down, overall operating revenue is projected \nto increase. This is due to funding from the \nprovincial government for collectively bargained \nsalary and benefits increases and funded \nenrolment for the technology expansion in \nsoftware engineering and computer science \nprograms. Significant work has been put into \nrecruitment for the coming year with a focus on \nundergraduate international recruitment.

Two significant \ncapital projects are underway –  the National \nCentre for Indigenous Laws (NCIL) and the \nEngineering and Computer Science expansion \nproject. Both projects will provide key space to \nsupport teaching and research capacity. Future \ncapital priorities have been identified in the \nCapital Plan and include  addressing deferred \nmaintenance, increasing student housing, \nenhance or repurpose current spaces and \nincrease academic and research space for those \nareas with the greatest pressures. Government \ncontributes towards these capital costs ; \nhowever, fundraising and university resources \nare important funding sources for these \ninfrastructure priorities.  \n \nFinancial Reporting Environment  \nThe university is part of the Government \nReporting Entity (GRE) of the Province of B.C. \nand, as such, is required to present its financial \nstatements in accordance with Section 23.1 of \nthe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act \nsupplemented by directives set out by the \nProvince. The Province has directed that PSAS be \nadopted without the PS4200 not -for-profit \nelections and  that all restricted contributions \nreceived for acquiring tangible capital assets be \ndeferred as Deferred Capital Contributions and \nrecognized in revenue at the same rate that the \namortization of the related tangible capital asset \nis recorded.  Some highlights of the reporting \nframework presentations are as follows: \nThe Statement of Financial Position reflects a  \n“Net Debt model” that presents Net Debt as the \ndifference between liabilities and financial assets \nand is intended to measure the u niversity’s \nfuture revenue requirements or  its ability to \nfinance its activities. Net debt at March 31, 2024 \nis $( 579M) but includes $ 529M of Deferred \nCapital Contribution liabilities that would likely \nnever be repaid, thus bringing into question its \nrelevance. The Statement of Financial Position \nalso presents an Accumulated Surplus of $941M, \nrepresenting the u niversity’s net assets. A \nbreakdown of this balance is disclosed on the \nStatement of Financial Position, and in the notes, \nto communicate to readers of the financial \nstatements that this figure mostly represents \nrestricted, spent or committed funds.  \nThe Statement of Operations reports revenues, \nfunctional expenses and budget figures for the \nuniversity’s consolidated operations. \nEndowment donations and investment income \ncapitalized to endowment principal, that used to \nbe recorded as direct increases in net assets, are \nrecorded on the Statement of Operations as \nRestricted Endowment Contributions  and \nincluded in Annual Operating Surplus,  even \nthough they are not available to fund \noperational expenses.  \nRemeasurement gains and losses, representing \nunrealized gains and losses on  unrestricted \ninvestments, derivatives and foreign currency , \nare reported on a separate statement and as a \nseparate category of Accumulated Surplus rather \nthan being included with the other components \nof investment income on the Statement of \nOperations. This effectively limits the ability to \nfund expenses from unrealized gains.  \nAccumulated remeasurement gains commenced \nas of April 1, 2012 onward reflect the prospective \nimplementation of the PSAS financial instrument \nstandard. \nA Statement of Changes in Net Debt summarizes \nthe key changes in Net Debt and provides",

The \nuniversity uses an Enterprise Risk Management \napproach and develops risk mitigation strategies \nto reduce the impact where possible. The major \nrisks that can affect the university from a \nfinancial perspective are as shown below.  The \nuniversity has institutional risk appetite \nstatements that help guide decision making \nacross all areas of campus.  \n \nStudent recruitment and retention  \nThe top institutional risk continues to be \nenrolment management. Our priority, for the \ncoming budget year is to attain our budgeted \nenrolment levels in order to stabilize our \nfinancial position. This work has included \nchanging admission processes and making \nsignificantly earlier offers to students. h Due to \nreduced undergraduate international \nenrolment, to balance the budget for 2024/25, \nreductions to general operating expenditures \nare required.  To protect against operational \nimpact from the current risky e nrolment \nenvironment, the budget includes an enrolment \ncontingency of $7.2M.  \nProvincial funding \nProvincial Government grants are a significant \ncomponent of revenue in the university’s \noperating budget. Funding for this source is not \nguaranteed year to year and provincial policy \nchanges can significantly affect institutional \nbudgets. Examples could include limits to tuition \nincreases or unexpected grants reductions. As \noperating grants are provided and approved for \none year only , there is uncertainty year to year \nwith respect to the university’s operating \nfunding. \nInflation \nStressed global supply chains  in 2023/24 led to \nsignificant inflation globally, including in Canada. \nThis inflation  is moderating after being at its \nhighest level in Canada since 1991. This is being \nclosely monitored for institutional impacts  and \nthe most significant inflation risk is with respect \nincreasing costs of capital for both the National \nCentre for Indigenous Laws and the Engineering \nexpansion projects. \nPensions and Employee Future Benefits  \nThe university has two pension plans for its \nfaculty, Professional Employee Association \nmembers, management exempt and executive \n(Combination Plan and Money Purchase Plan) \nand one plan for members of CUPE and exempt \nclerical staff (Staff Plan). The actuarial valuation \nof the Combination Plan, with an effective date \nof December 31, 2022, shows that the Plan is \nfully funded. The last valuation for the Staff \nPension Plan was December 31, 2022, which \nresulted in a going concern surplus funded ratio \nof 114% of liabilities but a solvency funded ratio \nof 85.1%. The Pension Benefits Standards \nRegulation was amended effective December 31, \n2019, introducing new going concern and \nfunding methodologies. The solvency funding \ntarget is now 85%, and a  letter of credit may be \nsecured in lieu of making payments  in the plan \nfalls below that threshold . As  at the latest \nvaluation the plan exceeds the 85% target a \nletter of credit is no longer required to secure the \nsolvency deficiency payment.",

Authority and purpose  \nThe University of Victoria (the “University”) operates under the authority of the University Act of British \nColumbia. The University is a not‑for‑profit entity governed by a 15 member Board of Governors, eight of \nwhom are appointed by the government of British Columbia including two on the recommendation of the \nAlumni Association. The University is a registered charity and is exempt from income taxes under section \n149 of the Income Tax Act.  \n2. Summary of significant accounting policies \nThe consolidated financial statements of the University are prepared by management in accordance with the \nbasis of accounting described below. Significant accounting policies of the University are as follows: \n(a) Basis of accounting  \nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 23.1 of the \nBudget Transparency and Accountability Act of the Province of British Columbia supplemented by \nRegulations 257/2010 and 198/2011 issued by the Province of British Columbia Treasury Board. \nThe Budget Transparency and Accountability Act requires that the consolidated financial statements be \nprepared in accordance with the set of standards and guidelines that comprise generally accepted \naccounting principles for senior governments in Canada, or if the Treasury Board makes a regulation, \nthe set of standards and guidelines that comprise generally accepted accounting principles for senior \ngovernments in Canada as modified by the alternate standard or guideline or part thereof adopted in \nthe regulation. \nRegulation 257/2010 requires all taxpayer supported organizations in the Schools, Universities, \nColleges and Hospitals sectors to adopt Canadian public sector accounting standards without any \nPS4200 elections related to not‑for‑profit accounting standards.   \nRegulation 198/2011 requires that restricted contributions received or receivable are to be reported \nas revenue depending on the nature of the restrictions on the use of the funds as follows: \n• Contributions for the purposes of acquiring or developing a depreciable tangible capital asset or \ncontributions in the form of a depreciable tangible capital asset are to be deferred and \nrecognized in revenue at the same rate that amortization of the related tangible capital asset is \nrecorded. \n• Contributions restricted for specific purposes other than those for the acquisition or \ndevelopment of a depreciable tangible capital asset are recorded as deferred contributions and \nrecognized in revenue in the period in which the stipulation or restriction on the contributions \nhave been met. \nFor British Columbia taxpayer supported organizations, these contributions include government \ntransfers and externally restricted contributions.",

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) \n(a) Basis of accounting (continued) \nThe accounting policy requirements under Regulation 198/2011 are significantly different from the \nrequirements of Canadian public sector accounting standards which requires that:  \n• government transfers, which do not contain a stipulation that creates a liability, be recognized as \nrevenue by the recipient when approved by the transferor and the eligibility criteria have been met \nin accordance with public sector accounting standard PS3410; and \n• externally restricted contributions be recognized as revenue in the period in which the resources \nare used for the purpose or purposes specified in accordance with public sector accounting \nstandard PS3100.  \nAs a result, revenue recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated surplus \nand certain related deferred capital contributions would be recorded differently under Canadian public \nsector accounting standards. \n(b) Basis of consolidation  \n(i) Consolidated entities  \nThe consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of \norganizations which are controlled by the University. Controlled organizations are consolidated \nexcept for government business enterprises which are accounted for by the modified equity \nmethod. Inter ‑organizational transactions, balances, and activities have been eliminated on \nconsolidation. \nThe following organizations are controlled by the University and fully consolidated in these \nfinancial statements: \n• UVic Industry Partnerships (formerly University of Victoria Innovation and Development \nCorporation) which facilitates research partnerships between the private sector and the \nUniversity. \n• University of Victoria Properties Investments Inc. which manages the University’s real estate \nholdings including the Vancouver Island Technology Park Trust. \n• Ocean Networks Canada Society which manages the University’s VENUS and NEPTUNE \nocean observatories. \n• Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium which stimulates collaboration to produce climate \ninformation for education, policy and decision making.",

Under this \nmethod, the University’s investment in the business enterprise and its net income and other \nchanges in equity are recorded. No adjustment is made to conform the accounting policies of \nthe government business enterprise to those of the University other than if other \ncomprehensive income exists, it is accounted for as an adjustment to accumulated surplus \n(deficit). Inter‑organizational transactions and balances have not been eliminated, except for any \nprofit or loss on transactions between entities of assets that remain within the entities controlled \nby the University. \nThe following organizations are controlled by the University and consolidated in these financial \nstatements using the modified equity basis: \n• Heritage Realty Properties Ltd. which manages the property rental and downtown hotel \nand brew‑pub operation donated by the late Michael C. Williams. \n• Vancouver Island Technology Park Trust which provides leased space to high ‑technology \ncompanies on Vancouver Island. \n• GSB Executive Education Inc. provides executive training and other non‑credit education. \n(iii) Investment in government partnerships  \nGovernment partnerships that are business partnerships are accounted for by the modified \nequity method.  Accounting policies of the business partnership are not conformed to those of \nthe partners before the equity pick -up.  The University is not party to any government business \npartnerships. \nGovernment partnerships that are not wholly controlled business partnerships are accounted for \nunder the proportionate consolidation method. The University accounts for its share of the \npartnership on a line by line basis on the financial statements and eliminates any \ninter‑organizational transactions and balances. Accounting policies of the partnership, which is \nnot a business partnership, are conformed to those of the University before it is proportionately \nconsolidated.",

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) \n (e)    Financial instruments (continued) \n(i) Fair value category (continued) \nUnrealized gains and losses on financial assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of \nremeasurement gains and losses until such time that the financial asset is derecognized due to \ndisposal or impairment. At the time of derecognition, the related realized gains and losses are \nrecognized in the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated surplus and related \nbalances reversed from the consolidated statement of remeasurement gains and losses. \nUnrealized gains and losses in endowment investments, where earnings are restricted as to use, \nare recorded as deferred contributions and recognized in revenue when disposed and when \nrelated expenses are incurred. Restricted unrealized gains spent to meet current year endowment \nexpenses or capitalization transfers are recorded in the consolidated statement of \nremeasurement gains and losses. Canadian public sector accounting standards require an \norganization to classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy, which includes \nthree levels of information that may be used to measure fair value: \n• Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets or \nliabilities; \n• Level 2 – Observable or corroborated inputs, other than level 1, such as quoted prices for \nsimilar assets or liabilities in active markets or market data for substantially the full term of \nthe assets or liabilities; and \n• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are \nsignificant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. \n(ii) Cost category  \nGains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated \nsurplus when the financial asset is derecognized due to disposal or impairment and the gains and \nlosses are recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method; accounts payable \nand accrued liabilities and debt are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest \nmethod. \nThe underwriting discount along with consulting fees relating to the debenture issuances are \ncapitalized and amortized to match the term of the long -term debenture. Amortization is \ncalculated based on the effective interest rate method. \n(f) Short-term investments  \nShort-term investments are comprised of money market securities and other investments with \nmaturities that are capable of prompt liquidation.  Short -term investments are cashable on demand \nand are recorded at cost based on the transaction price on the trade date.

Cost includes the original purchase cost, plus shipping and applicable duties. \nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price less any costs to sell. \n(h) Asset retirement obligations \nAn asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) is recognized when, as at the financial reporting date, all of \nthe following criteria are met: \n• There is a legal obligation to incur retirement costs in relation to a tangible capital asset \n• The past transaction or event giving rise to the liability has occurred \n• It is expected that future economic benefits will be given up; and \n• A reasonable estimate of the amount can be made \nCertain buildings owned by the University contain asbestos and other hazardous materials. The ARO \nliability for the removal of asbestos and other hazardous materials in buildings owned by the \nUniversity has been recognized based on the estimated future expenses to remediate the buildings. \nUnder the modified retrospective method, the assumptions used on initial recognition are those as of \nthe date of adoption of the standard.  Assumptions used in the subsequent calculations are revised \nannually.  When the amount and timing of future cash flows of a remediation or demolition of a \nproject are known, the liability is discounted using a present value calculation, and adjusted yearly for \naccretion expense up to the time the project commences. \nThe recognition of the ARO liability resulted in an accompanying increase to the respective tangible \ncapital assets.  The increase in building assets is being amortized in accordance with the amortization \naccounting policy outlined in Note 2(i)(i). \n(i) Non‑financial assets  \nNon‑financial assets are not available to discharge existing liabilities and are held for use in the \nprovision of services. They have useful lives extending beyond the current year and are not intended \nfor sale in the ordinary course of operations.  \n(i) Tangible capital assets  \nTangible capital assets are recorded at cost, which includes amounts that are directly attributable \nto acquisition, construction, development or betterment of the asset. Interest is capitalized \nduring construction whenever external debt is issued to finance the construction of tangible \ncapital assets.",

The budget was approved by the \nBoard of Governors of the University on September 27, 2023 and provided to the Province. The \nbudget is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations and accumulated surplus and the \nconsolidated statement of changes in net debt.  \n \n(q) Adoption of new accounting standards \n(i) On April 1, 2023, the University adopted Canadian Public Sector Accounting Standard PS 3160, \nPublic Private Partnerships (“PS 3160”). The new accounting standard addresses the \nrecognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of infrastructure procured by public \nsector entities through certain types of public private partnership arrangements.

Under the new accounting standard, there are two categories of revenue \n– exchange and non -exchange. If the transaction gives rise to one or more performance \nobligations, it is an exchange transaction. If no performance obligations are present, it is a non -\nexchange transaction. Management has assessed the impact of adopting PS 3400 on the \nconsolidated financial statements of the University and has found that there is no resulting \nimpact to the consolidated financial statements.  \n(iii) On April 1, 2023, the University adopted Public Sector Guideline PSG -8, Purchased \nIntangibles. PSG -8 defines purchased intangibles as identifiable nonmonetary economic \nresources without physical substance acquired through an arm’s length exchange transaction \nbetween knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion to act. Intangibles \nacquired through a transfer, contribution, or inter -entity transaction, are not purchased \nintangibles. Management has assessed the impact of adopting PSG -8 and found that at present \nno such items meet the criteria to be recognized as a purchased intangible.",

The employees make contributions equal to 4.00% of salary up to the year’s \nmaximum pensionable earnings (“YMPE”) plus 6.00% of salary in excess of the YMPE. The \nUniversity makes contributions equal to 6.37% of salary up to the YMPE plus 8.00% of salary in \nexcess of the YMPE. The university also contributes 4.00% of salary to fund the defined benefit \nminimum.

Though the University and the employees \nboth contribute to the pension fund, the University retains the full risk of the accrued benefit \nobligation. The pension fund assets are invested primarily in Universe bonds and equities. \nThe University has made contributions to the Plan during the year of $6,526,000 (2023 –\n$6,110,000).  The Plan paid benefits in the year of $15,670,000 (2023 – $15,776,000). \n \nThe net pension asset at March 31 includes the following components: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActuarial valuations are performed triennially using the projected benefit prorated method. The \nlatest triennial actuarial valuation completed as at December 31, 2022 reported a going concern \nsurplus and a solvency deficiency (i.e. if the plan were to be wound up on that date) of \n$57,243,000. The next required valuation will be as at December 31, 2025, which will be \ncompleted in the summer of 2026. As of March 31, 2024, The Pension Benefits Standards Act of \nBritish Columbia requires minimum annual contributions or the use of letters of credit to fund a \nportion of the solvency deficiency if the plan’s solvency ratio is below 85%.

Amortization of these assets will \ncommence when the asset is available for productive use. \n(c) De-recognition of tangible capital assets \nThe de-recognition of tangible capital assets during the year had an original cost of $40,978,000 (2023 \n– $26,414,000) and related to fully amortized assets with a net book value of $nil (2023 – $nil).   \n(d) Interest capitalized during construction \nThe University capitalized interest during the year of $190,000 (2023 - $1,293,000) related to the \nconstruction of the Student Housing and Dining (SHD) project. \n \n17. Financial risk management  \n \nThe University has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk, price \nrisk and liquidity risk.  The Board of Governors ensures that the University has identified major risks and \nmanagement monitors and controls them. \n(a) Credit risk  \nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the University if a customer or counterparty to a financial \ninstrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Such risks arise principally from the amounts \nreceivable and from fixed income assets held by the University.  \nThe University manages amounts receivable by using a specific bad debt provision when management \nconsiders that the expected recovery is less than the account receivable.  \nThe entity is exposed to credit risk through its accounts receivable from students.  This risk is managed \nby limiting the extent of credit granted to students and by monitoring the collection of receivables. \n \n  2024 2023 \nEquipment and furnishings $                250 $                 20",

Financial risk management (continued) \n(a) Credit risk (continued) \nThe University limits the risk in the event of non ‑performance related to fixed income holdings by \ndealing principally with counter ‑parties that have a credit rating of A or higher as rated by the \nDominion Bond Rating Service or equivalent. The credit risk of the University investments at March \n31, 2024 is $349,005,000 (2023 – $359,106,000).  \nThe following shows the percentage of fixed income holdings in the portfolio by credit rating: \n(b) Price risk  \nPrice risk includes market risk and interest rate risk. \nMarket risk relates to the possibility that the investments will change in value due to fluctuations in \nmarket prices.  The objective of market risk management is to mitigate market risk exposures within \nacceptable parameters while optimizing the return on risk. This risk is mitigated by the investment \npolicies for the respective asset mixes to be followed by the investment managers, the requirements for \ndiversification of investments within each asset class and credit quality constraints on fixed income \ninvestments. Market risk can be measured in terms of volatility, i.e., the standard deviation of change in \nthe value of a financial instrument within a specific time horizon.  \n \nCredit Rating % \nAAA 9.5% \nAA 6.6% \nA 6.7% \nBBB 9.0% \nBB and below 2.0% \nMortgages 14.3% \nForeign exchange 0.2% \nCash and short-term  \nR1 high 39.2% \nR1 mid 1.0% \nR1 low 11.5% \n  100.0%",

Financial risk management (continued) \n(b) Price risk (continued) \nBased on the volatility of the University’s current asset class holdings, the net impact on market value \nof each asset class is shown below. \n \nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will \nfluctuate because of changes in the market interest rates. The value of fixed ‑income and debt \nsecurities, such as bonds, debentures, mortgages or other income ‑producing securities is affected by \ninterest rates. Generally, the value of these securities increases if interest rates fall and decreases if \ninterest rates rise. \nIt is management's opinion that the University is exposed to market or interest rate risk arising from its \nfinancial instruments. Duration is an appropriate measure of interest rate risk for fixed income funds as \na rise (fall) in interest rates will cause a decrease (increase) in bond prices; the longer the duration, the \ngreater the effect. Duration is managed by the investment manager at the fund level. At March 31, \n2024, the modified duration of all fixed income in aggregate was 2.5 years. Therefore, if interest rates \nwere to increase by 1% across all maturities, the value of the bond portfolio would drop by 2.5%; \ncontrarily, if interest rates were to decrease by 1% across all maturities, the value of the bond portfolio \nwould increase by 2.5%.  \nThe University’s debt is fixed rate; accordingly, changes in interest rates do not impact interest \npayments but may impact the fair value of such debt and the fair value of related derivatives (interest \nrate swaps on debt). The University uses interest rate swaps to lock in interest rates on future debt \nissues to protect against rising interest rates. \n \n \nAsset Class   \nEstimated Volatility    \n(% change) \nBonds +/- 5.8% \nCanadian equities +/- 20.0% \nGlobal equities +/-  18.0% \nReal estate +/-  12.5% \nInfrastructure +/-  12.5% \nPrivate equity +/-  21.0% \nBenchmark for Investments   \n Net Impact on     \nMarket Value \nFTSE Canada Universe Bond index +/- $                      10,748                        \nS&P/TSX Composite index +/- 417 \nMSCI All Country World Index +/-           60,837 \nMSCI/REALPAC Canada Quarterly Property Fund Index +/-                        7,237  \nCanadian Consumer Price Index (Infrastructure) +/- 2,136        \nCanadian Consumer Price Index (Private Equity) +/-  185",

Your institution is expected to work with government to report out on these plans \nand activities as required by legislation. \nmarginalized people face historic and present-day barriers that limit their full participation in their \ncommunities, workplaces, government and their lives. The public sector has a moral and ethical \nresponsibility to tackle systemic discrimination in all its forms and every public sector organization \nhas a role in this work. As part of this work, your organization is expected to adopt the Gender-\nBased Analysis Plus (GBA+) lens to ensure gender equity is reflected in your operations and \nprograms.  \nBritish Columbians expect that public sector organizations operate in a responsible manner to \ndeliver quality services equitably in all regions of the province. This requires strategic stewardship of \nplanning, operations and policies in the areas of financial, risk and human resource management \nincluding information security and privacy protection. \nThe protection of government data and networks is a priority, especially where it concerns personal \ninformation of British Columbians. Public sector organizations must maintain up to date systems and \neffective cybersecurity practices, including maintaining current information management and \ncybersecurity policies, guidelines and standards; evaluating your organization against industry \nstandards and maintaining appropriate security and privacy practices. The Office of the Chief \nInformation Officer within the Ministry of Citizens Services is available to support and offer guidance \nto your organization in any of these areas. \nPublic sector organizations must also implement and maintain an effective fraud risk management \nstrategy. The Office of the Comptroller General and the Risk Management Branch in the Ministry of \nFinance are available for consultation. \nThe Crown Agencies Secretariat (CAS) in the Ministry of Finance supports public sector \norganizations to operate effectively, in the public interest and aligned with governments strategic \ndirection and priorities. Within CAS, the Crown Agencies and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO) will \ncontinue to support you and your board on recruitment, appointments and professional development, \nas well as ensuring board composition and governance reflects the diversity of our province.

We are prepared to face a changing world \nwith renewed commitment, enthusiasm, compassion and humility.\nThis moment will define our future. It will need us to try new ways of teaching, and new methods of tackling the \nworld’s most complex problems through creativity, innovative research and partnerships—building community \ninside and outside the classroom. Now is the time to re-imagine the lab and studio, libraries and offices, campus \nand community to create interconnected and interdisciplinary opportunities.  \nThis is the start of our next 60 years. It’s our moment to be Distinctly UVic.\nNow is the time\nOur times are marked by immediate challenges: \nfrom health crises and climate change to geopolitical \ninstability and the hard but necessary work of \nconfronting difficult truths about our history. \nHow we respond is up to us, but we need to do it now. \nThis is an exhilarating time of innovation, collaboration \nand possibility. It is time to lead with our values and live \nup to our commitments to: \n\t Redress historical barriers to higher education  \nfor Indigenous Peoples. \n\t Uphold equity and create a culture of belonging. \n\t Address the climate crisis to ensure a more \nsustainable and fair future. \n\t Embrace innovation and community partnerships.\nThe world and the communities connected to UVic \nneed us to work together to find new ways of learning, \nthinking and working. The world needs critical thinkers \nand interdisciplinary solutions; it needs perseverance \nand openness to the challenges ahead. It doesn’t \nneed us to be a wildly different UVic—it needs us to \nbe bolder, more confident and more curious, but still \ndistinctly who we are.\nWe must continue to amplify how our research, \ncreativity and teaching responds to global \nopportunities. We must drive innovation, create \npartnerships and nurture the next generation of \nleaders, thinkers and citizens. We must strive to be \nrelevant to local communities while also making a \nglobal impact. We must think critically about who we \nare and how we move in the world, embracing values  \nof equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging. \nNow is the time to be Distinctly UVic.",

Foundational to this plan is our commitment to the Lək̓ ʷəŋən Peoples, the Songhees \nand Esquimalt Nations, and the W ̱ SÁNEĆ Nations, who have continuing relationships with and inherent rights to \nthe land on which the university stands and to its neighbouring territories. \nAs part of UVic’s commitment to upholding the rights and sovereignties of Indigenous Peoples, we recognize and \nacknowledge the damaging and colonial history of education in this country. We are committed to living up to and \nbeyond the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the BC Declaration on the Rights \nof Indigenous Peoples Act. \nA commitment to Indigenous rights and to honouring the First Peoples of this territory is an essential step in \ncreating the conditions in which everyone feels a sense of belonging within a respectful, welcoming community.\nA note about language and teachings \nLanguage is the foundation of Indigenous laws, worldviews and ways \nof knowing and being. The protection and revitalization of Indigenous \nlanguages is a priority for local Indigenous communities and for UVic. \nThroughout this plan names and teachings are provided in Lək̓ ʷəŋən | \nSENĆOŦEN | English. These words and teachings have been shared with \nthe university community by Elders, Language and Knowledge Keepers \nfrom the local Nations, and we are charged with upholding them through \nthe Coast Salish teaching of Nəw̓ es šxʷ cən ʔay̓  šqʷeləqʷən | ÁMEḴT \nTŦEN ÍY, ŚḰÁLEȻEN | Bring in a your good heart and mind.\nElders Seniemten, Dr. Elmer George (Songhees Nation) and J,SIṈTEN,  \nDr. John Elliott (Tsartlip First Nation) have provided permission and \nguidance on the use of Lək̓ ʷəŋən and SENĆOŦEN respectively  \nthroughout this document. \nA NEW KIND OF PLAN\nA distinct approach, building on a strong foundation\nTo develop this strategic plan, we stepped back to get a broad view of \nour journey over the past 60 years. Our new plan is built on a strong \nfoundation of excellence in teaching, research and creative works, and \nour commitment to an outstanding student experience. \nWe also asked tough questions about what is needed from and \nexpected of us. We heard from thousands of people like you: students, \nstaff, faculty, alumni, retirees, donors, community members, Elders, \npartners and so many more. Through more than 6,000 engagements, \nwe heard what the world needs from UVic, what you need from UVic \nand the impact we should be striving for in this moment. \nWe heard that UVic must tackle the big issues we are all facing as a \nsociety and a world, and be transparent about the role that universities \nhave played in upholding the dominant systems of power, including \ncolonization, white supremacy, historical trauma and patriarchal \nnorms. This plan challenges us—leadership, individuals and the  \nentire community—to resist these systems and be accountable to  \nour commitments. \nThe following pages don’t capture every detail of what we do at \nUVic. This plan urges us to be creative, innovative, collaborative, \ncompassionate and brilliant—not on our own, but together. Bringing \ntogether different perspectives and lived experiences is what allows  \nus to build better solutions. We are ready to take action and lift up  \nthe expectations we have for each other and the role UVic has in the \nworld and the communities we serve.\nInterconnected plans\nLook to the existing and emerging \ninitiatives and goals that have been \narticulated in major institutional plans \nlike Xʷkʷənəŋistəl | W ̱ ȻENEṈISTEL | \nHelping to move each other forward: \nUVic’s Indigenous Plan, the Equity \nAction Plan, Aspiration 2030: UVic \nResearch and Creative Works Strategy, \nthe Climate and Sustainability Action \nPlan, and the forthcoming academic \nand global engagement plans. \nThese plans, along with the \noperational plans that direct our \ndaily activities, have been created  \nby the UVic community and guide us \nas a community and an institution \ntoward fulfilling the shared purpose, \npledge, principles and priorities \narticulated in the strategic plan.\nHear these \nteachings spoken",
